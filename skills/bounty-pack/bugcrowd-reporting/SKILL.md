# BUGCROWD REPORTING — Program-Specific Tactics

> Companion to the generic `report-writing` skill. Use when working specifically on Bugcrowd submissions where VRT mapping, OOS-clause rebuttals, or per-program target selection matter.

This skill encodes patterns that apply specifically to Bugcrowd's submission flow. For the generic per-platform templates (HackerOne / Bugcrowd / Intigriti / Immunefi report bodies), use the `report-writing` skill. For the 7-Question Gate before deciding to report at all, use `triage-validation`.

---

## 1. VRT Category Selection — Search & Fallback Strategy

Bugcrowd's submission form requires a single VRT (Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy) selection. The dropdown's default severity is bound to the chosen node — pick wrong and the form auto-suggests a lower priority (often P4) when the actual impact is P3 or P2.

> Note: VRT default severities are not fixed constants. Bugcrowd revises the VRT schema across versions, and individual programs can remap defaults via their own priority configuration. The P-values shown in the examples below (e.g., "No Rate Limiting on Form → Login" defaulting to P4) are the typical baseline at time of writing — always read the severity the *current* form actually auto-suggests for *this* program rather than assuming the value here.

### 1.1 Search hierarchy (try in order, pick the highest-severity match that still describes the bug)

For any finding, search the VRT dropdown with these terms in this order:

1. **The bug's primary class** — e.g., `IDOR`, `XSS`, `SSRF`, `auth bypass`, `2FA bypass`
2. **The data category exposed** — e.g., `PII`, `sensitive data exposure`, `disclosure of secrets`
3. **The control bypassed** — e.g., `broken access control`, `authentication bypass`
4. **The endpoint type** — e.g., `no rate limiting on form > login`, `no rate limiting on form > change password`
5. **The generic parent node** — e.g., `Server Security Misconfiguration > Other`, `Broken Access Control > Other`

### 1.2 Pick the highest-severity match that still accurately describes the bug

Never select a VRT that misrepresents the bug just to get a higher default severity. Triagers will reassign and may flag the misrepresentation. The discipline is: pick the most specific *accurate* VRT, then use §2 (Manual Severity Override) if the default is wrong.

### 1.3 Common mappings worth knowing

| Finding type | First-choice VRT | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| ATO via missing 2FA on password change | Broken Authentication & Session Management → Second Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA) → Bypass | Broken Auth → Authentication Bypass → Other |
| Password oracle without rate limit | Broken Authentication & Session Management → Authentication Bypass → Other | Server Security Misconfiguration → No Rate Limiting on Form → Login |
| GraphQL introspection / APQ allowlist bypass | Server Security Misconfiguration → Other (justify in body) | Broken Access Control → Other |
| Username → real name PII enumeration | Sensitive Data Exposure → PII Leakage / Disclosure of Secrets → Non-Corporate User | Broken Access Control → Other |
| State desync on security-sensitive action | Application-Level DoS → Other (with state-desync framing) | Server Security Misconfiguration → Other |
| Email/SMS pumping on auth-flow endpoint | Server Security Misconfiguration → No Rate Limiting on Form → Email-Triggering / SMS-Triggering | Server Security Misconfiguration → No Rate Limiting on Action |
| Token brute-force (email-change OTP, password reset) | Broken Authentication → Authentication Bypass → Other | Server Security Misconfiguration → No Rate Limiting on Action |

### 1.4 If no good VRT exists

Pick `Server Security Misconfiguration → Other` or `Broken Access Control → Other` and **lead the description body with a "VRT mapping note"** explaining why the chosen node is the closest available match and what the bug actually is.

---

## 2. Manual Severity Override

Bugcrowd's form lets you manually set Technical Severity *separate from the VRT default*. The form text itself states: *"A severity rating suggested by the VRT is not guaranteed to be the severity rating applied to your submission."*

### 2.1 When to override

Override the VRT default when:
- The chained outcome is a higher severity than the standalone bug class (chain → ATO)
- The VRT category is approximate and its default doesn't reflect the actual impact class
- The program's own Focus Areas explicitly list this outcome at a higher severity than VRT's default
- The data class exposed is more sensitive than the VRT's example uses (e.g., real-name PII vs. handle enumeration)

### 2.2 How to override (form mechanics)

1. Select the VRT that most accurately describes the bug (per §1)
2. Note the auto-suggested severity (P4, P3, etc.)
3. In the **Technical Severity** field, manually pick the severity you're requesting
4. Add a **Severity Request** paragraph as the FIRST section of the description body (per §3)

### 2.3 Don't over-claim

P1 inflation is the fastest way to lose triager trust. Reserve P1 for ATO without interaction, RCE, mass PII exfiltration, fund theft, and similar Critical-bucket impacts. If the chain to P1 requires a separate stolen-cookie premise, file the standalone primitive at P3 and discuss the chain explicitly with cross-references (per §4).

---

## 3. Severity-Request Paragraph — Always First in the Body

When the VRT default underrates impact, the FIRST section of the description body should be a severity-request paragraph. This is the first thing the triager reads and it pre-empts the auto-close that often happens when triagers see "P4" in the form.

### 3.1 Template

```markdown
## Severity request — please review carefully before applying VRT default

The closest VRT category for this finding is "[chosen VRT]," which Bugcrowd defaults to **P[N] ($X-$Y in [program]'s rubric)**. **I am requesting evaluation at P[M] [standalone | in chain with submission XXXX]** for the following reasons:

1. **[Impact axis 1]** — [specific reason this finding exceeds the VRT default's example]
2. **[Impact axis 2]** — [specific reason, often citing the program's own Focus Areas]
3. **[Impact axis 3]** — [specific reason, often comparing to historical bounty payouts for the same data class]

[Optional: one paragraph contrasting the VRT default's typical example with this finding's actual impact, e.g., "P4 = No Rate Limiting on Login Form" applies to ordinary login pages where brute force is bounded by lockout policies; this endpoint has neither lockout nor throttle.]
```

### 3.2 Worked example pattern

```markdown
## Severity request — please review carefully before applying VRT default

The closest VRT category for this finding is "No Rate Limiting on Form → Login," which Bugcrowd defaults to **P4 ($XX–$YY in this program's rubric)**. **I am requesting evaluation at P3 standalone, P2 in chain with submission XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX** for the following reasons:

1. **[Endpoint] is a password-disclosure oracle, not a generic rate-limit gap.** The endpoint returns true/false for a supplied password — combined with cookie theft, it is the exact primitive an attacker uses to learn the victim's *durable* credential from a stolen *transient* session.
2. **The chained outcome is "Account Takeover,"** explicitly listed under the program → Focus Areas → Critical (P1) examples. This finding is one of two independent links that make that chain work; the other is submission XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX.
3. **The two findings have independent fix surfaces.** Per the program's "one fix = one bounty" rule they should be evaluated as two separate findings whose chain raises the joint severity.

The "P4 = No Rate Limiting on Login Form" default applies to ordinary login pages where brute-force is bounded by lockout policies. This endpoint has neither lockout nor throttle, and the result of brute force is the *user's actual password* (not a session) — making the impact significantly higher than the default VRT severity assumes.
```

### 3.3 Tone guidelines

- Open with *"Severity request — please review carefully before applying VRT default"* (literal phrase). Triagers recognize this and don't auto-close.
- Use **bold** sparingly; one or two phrases per reason at most.
- Never use "could potentially" or "may allow" — these are downgrade-bait.
- Cite the program's own Focus Areas / accepted-impact list by exact name.
- Cross-reference linked submissions by full submission ID (UUID format).

---

## 4. OOS-Clause Rebuttals — Templates

Bugcrowd triagers sometimes auto-close findings by mapping them to an OOS clause without reading the report. Pre-empt this by including an **In-scope justification** section that quotes the OOS clause and explains why your finding doesn't fit it.

### 4.1 "Rate limiting on non-authentication endpoints" rebuttal

When the finding is on an authentication endpoint (login, password change, password verify, OTP verify, token validate):

```markdown
## In-scope justification

The program OOS list excludes "Rate limiting or brute-force issues on **non-authentication** endpoints." `[endpoint name]` is the canonical authentication endpoint — it accepts a password/token/OTP and returns whether it matches the user's stored credential. By definition this is an authentication primitive. The OOS clause's "non-authentication" qualifier therefore does NOT apply.
```

### 4.2 "Debug information disclosure" rebuttal (for schema/introspection findings)

When the finding involves schema disclosure that's actually a control bypass (e.g., GraphQL allowlist bypass exposing the mutation surface):

```markdown
## In-scope justification

This is not a "debug information" finding. The [persisted-query allowlist | introspection gate | etc.] is acting as an authorization control on the [GraphQL surface | API tree | etc.]. The bypass converts that gate into a no-op — multiple [mutations | endpoints] become reachable that the official clients cannot invoke. The schema disclosure is incidental; the impact is **mutation-surface unlock**, not information leakage.
```

### 4.3 "User enumeration with low-risk information" rebuttal

When the finding leaks more than just "this handle/email exists":

```markdown
## In-scope justification

The program OOS list excludes "User Enumeration issues with **low-risk and insignificant** information being enumerated." The data leaked here is **neither low-risk nor insignificant**: it includes the matched user's [full real first name, last name, profile photo / SSN last 4 / phone number / etc.]. Real-[name | identity | etc.] knowledge is the same data class that gates the program's own [account-recovery flows / fraud-investigation interviews / support-call verification], which means this lookup directly defeats one of the program's own anti-fraud controls. This is PII disclosure, not handle enumeration.
```

### 4.4 "Theoretical issues / not exploitable" rebuttal

When the finding's exploitability has been demonstrated end-to-end:

```markdown
## In-scope justification

This finding is exploitable end-to-end as demonstrated in the PoC: [one-sentence summary of the proven exploitation path]. The PoC includes [N HTTP requests with redacted cookies | N screenshots | a sanitized HAR file | etc.] showing the attacker's session [reading victim data | changing victim credentials | etc.]. The OOS clause for "theoretical issues that are not exploitable, or can not be demonstrated as exploitable" does not apply.
```

### 4.5 If you don't have end-to-end proof

If you only have an "API behavior" observation without a fully demonstrated exploitation path, the finding is theoretical. Don't file it. Capture the missing evidence (delivery confirmation, token-format inspection, cross-account victim data in response, etc.) and re-evaluate. Filing theoretical findings damages researcher reputation on the platform.

---

## 5. Chained Findings — Cross-Reference Strategy

Many high-impact findings are chains of two or more standalone primitives (oracle + missing step-up = ATO). Bugcrowd's program rule: *"Submit one vulnerability per report. If multiple vulnerabilities must be chained to demonstrate impact, you may include them together, but please clearly explain the chain."*

### 5.1 Filing strategy for chains

1. **Identify the highest-severity chained outcome** (typically the one that maps to a P1/P2 example in the program's Focus Areas).
2. **File the chain primitives FIRST** as separate reports — each at its standalone severity (typically P3/P4). A submission's UUID only exists *after* it is filed, so the primitives must exist before anything can reference them. Leave the cross-reference line in each primitive's body as a placeholder for now.
3. **File the chain consumer** — the report whose body describes the full ATO/RCE/etc. impact at the chained severity (e.g., P1). Because the primitives already exist, fill in their real UUIDs in the consumer's "Chain partners" block (per §5.2).
4. **Edit each primitive after filing the consumer** to backfill the consumer's UUID: *"Chain partner: submission [UUID] for the full impact narrative."* (The reference is bidirectional, so one report must be edited after the other is filed — Bugcrowd allows post-submission edits to the description body.)

### 5.2 Cross-reference template

In the chain consumer's body, near the top:

```markdown
## Chain partners (filed as separate reports)

- **submission [UUID-1]** — [primitive 1: e.g., `me.verify_password` no rate limit]
- **submission [UUID-2]** — [primitive 2: e.g., GraphQL APQ allowlist bypass]

These primitives have independent fix surfaces and are filed separately per the program's "one fix = one bounty" rule. The chained impact described here requires both primitives to be exploited end-to-end.
```

In each primitive's body:

```markdown
## Chain context

This finding is the [N]th of [M] independent primitives that together produce [impact, e.g., "permanent account takeover from a stolen session cookie"]. The full chain narrative and the chained severity (P1) are documented in submission [UUID]. This standalone report is at P3 reflecting the primitive's individual impact.
```

### 5.3 What NOT to do

- Don't paste the entire chain narrative into every primitive's body. Cross-reference instead.
- Don't claim each primitive is independently P1 — overclaiming damages credibility for all linked reports.
- Don't ask for a single combined bounty for the chain. The program's "one fix = one bounty" rule means each independent fix surface is a separate bounty. Frame the chain as a severity-amplifier, not a merge request.

---

## 6. Target Selection — QA vs. Production

Programs that scope both production and QA assets (e.g., `app.target.com` vs. `app-qa.target.com`) require careful target selection.

### 6.1 Picking the right target dropdown entry

| If you tested... | Pick this target | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Production app/API | The production target | Most accurate; signals the impact landed on real users |
| QA app/API (per program rules for non-US researchers) | The QA target (e.g., `Sign In - (QA)`, `Enrollment - (QA)`) | Accurate per program rules; signals friendly tester |
| QA but no specific QA target exists | Closest matching production target with a clear QA disclaimer in the body | Triager will reassign correctly if needed |
| Cross-asset finding (multiple targets affected) | The asset where the bug originates / has the highest impact | Add list of other affected targets in the body |

### 6.2 QA-disclaimer paragraph (when filing a QA-tested finding)

```markdown
## Notes for triagers

- Tested in the QA environment ([qa-host]) per the program's instruction for non-US researchers / per the program's QA-testing scope.
- Production may enforce additional controls that QA does not — please confirm whether the same resolver code path runs on production.
- All testing limited to my own QA test account; no other accounts were interacted with.
- Selected target: `[chosen-target]`. Selected VRT: `[chosen-VRT]`. Both selected as closest available matches; please reassign if more appropriate options exist.
```

---

## 7. Researcher-Side Hygiene (Bugcrowd-specific)

These are program-rule items that affect submission quality even though they're not part of the report body itself.

### 7.1 Account email — BC_ALIAS alias

Most Bugcrowd-managed programs ask researchers to use their `@BC_ALIAS.com` alias as the account email on the target. This flags traffic as friendly-tester to the target's fraud team. Steps:

0. **This operator's alias is `RESEARCHER_BC_EMAIL`** (Bugcrowd handle `BC_USERNAME`). Use it
   verbatim for program sign-ups; do not substitute the gmail address, and do not guess a
   different handle.
1. Sign up for the target using that alias (format is `handle@BC_ALIAS.com`)
2. If you already have an account, update the email to the alias before testing
3. If the program offers a contact path for multi-account testing, use that to coordinate additional aliased accounts (`alias+test1@BC_ALIAS.com`, etc.)
4. Document the alias in the report's "Notes for triagers" section so the triager can correlate test traffic in their logs

### 7.2 Account-state restoration after PoC

After demonstrating any state-changing action (password change, email change, device removal, money transfer):

1. Restore the account to its pre-PoC state immediately (e.g., revert the password to what it was)
2. Document the restoration in the report — *"Account state was restored immediately after the PoC."*
3. If restoration is impossible (e.g., a sent email cannot be unsent), document the residual state honestly

### 7.3 Cookie / session rotation after submission

After submitting any report that includes session-cookie-derived evidence:

1. Log out and log back in to rotate the session cookie
2. Any cookie value visible in screenshots / HARs you submitted is now dead
3. Optionally, rotate the test-account password to a fresh value not used elsewhere — that way passwords visible in PoC screenshots are also dead

### 7.4 If the test account gets locked

1. Don't create a second account to bypass the lock — that looks like fraud
2. Email the program-specific contact (if provided) with your Bugcrowd username and the report ID
3. Wait for the program team to unblock you; testing during the lock period damages credibility

### 7.5 Account auto-restricted seconds after signup (anti-fraud, not a bug)

A brand-new account can be locked before you perform a single test action. On Vinted (2026-10-01)
the first navigation after a *successful* registration resolved to `/main/banned`, and
`GET /restrictions/api/v1/user-restrictions` returned
`{"permitted_actions":[1,2],"restriction_type":2}`.

Read it correctly: the trigger was the **signup itself** — an automated browser session plus a
datacentre/VPN egress. The `@BC_ALIAS.com` alias is what the brief asks for, so it is not the
problem on its own; it is the combination that scores. Consequences and the right moves:

- **Do not** re-run the registration flow or create a second account to get around the block. That
  is precisely the abuse pattern the program is defending against, and it costs credibility.
- File a support ticket that names the exact account (login, id, email) and quotes the exact
  evidence (endpoint + response body), and states plainly that **no testing had occurred** from the
  account. Ask for either an unblock or the signup path they prefer (allow-listed IP, program-
  provisioned researcher account, specific method). Keep it factual — no accusations, no theories.
- The fastest legitimate route in parallel: have the operator sign up in their **own** browser from a
  residential IP, then hand the session cookies to the harness. That is faster and cleaner than
  fighting the bot wall.
- While blocked, redirect the round to the parts of the scope that need no account (secondary hosts,
  static marketing properties, the mobile binary), and state that split explicitly in the coverage
  statement. Do not report an empty round and do not report the restriction as a finding.

---

## 8. Submission-Order Strategy for Multi-Finding Engagements

When you have multiple findings from a single engagement, the order matters.

### 8.1 Recommended order

1. **Chain primitives before their consumer.** A consumer references the primitives' report UUIDs, which only exist once the primitives are filed (see §5.1). File the best-evidenced primitive first to lock your timestamp, then the rest of the chain's primitives.
2. **The chain consumer next** — fill in the real primitive UUIDs, then edit each primitive to backfill the consumer's UUID (Bugcrowd allows post-submission body edits).
3. **Standalone P3 findings next.** Order by quality of evidence: best-evidenced first, riskier (OOS-adjacent) findings later.
4. **OOS-risky findings last.** By the time these land, you've established a credible track record on this engagement.

### 8.2 Tracking submission IDs

Maintain a simple text file with each submission's UUID, severity, and one-line description. You'll reference these IDs across reports and during any subsequent triager dialogue.

### 8.3 What to avoid

- Don't file all findings in a single batch within minutes. Triagers see this as low-effort spam.
- Don't file an OOS-risky finding before a clean P3 from the same engagement. The clean one establishes credibility; the risky one benefits from being read in that context.
- Don't disclose any findings publicly until the program explicitly says it's OK. Bugcrowd's confidentiality applies to both unresolved AND resolved issues.

---

## 9. Reading a VDP Page, and Honouring Its Scope

### 9.1 Fetching the program page (two easy ways to waste a turn)

- **URL form is program-dependent — try BOTH, do not trust either claim blindly.** Verified
  2026-10-01 on `vinted-uab-mbb`: `https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/<slug>` returned **200** with
  the full page (107 KB), while `https://bugcrowd.com/<slug>` returned **404** — the exact
  inverse of the Kmart VDP case (where the bare slug worked and `engagements/` 404'd). So:
  curl both forms once, take whichever answers 200, and never conclude "the program is private
  or removed" from a single 404.
- **Some campaign JSON is public without auth — harvest it before you render anything.** With the
  engagement slug, these answered 200 anonymously (2026-10-01):
  `/engagements/<slug>/statistics` → `{"rewardedVulnerabilities":7,"averagePayout":"$421.42"}`
  (program maturity + whether it is worth the time), `/engagements/<slug>/scope_ranks` →
  `{"scopeRank":3}`, `/engagements/<slug>/hall_of_fames.json?latest=true`,
  `/engagements/<slug>/recently_joined_users.json`. Meanwhile
  `/engagements/<slug>/engagement_known_issues.json` answers
  `401 {"error":"You need to sign in or sign up before continuing."}` — the known-issues list
  needs the researcher session, so do not record it as "no known issues" when it is a 401.
  The rendered HTML also carries a `data-api-endpoints` attribute listing the rest of the
  campaign API surface (brief versions, announcements, changelog) if you would rather hit JSON.
- **The page is JS-rendered.** Raw HTML contains only meta tags and the api-endpoints blob; the
  scope table is not in it. Render with a real browser (`page.inner_text("body")`) to read
  Description / Targets / testing rules / exclusions, and save that text to the engagement log —
  it is the authority you will quote back when a triager disputes scope.

### 9.2 Scope discipline — enumerate broadly, TEST only what is named

The scope block names specific URLs ("This is the production environment" + a target table).
Subdomain enumeration will happily return far more than the scope names. **Do not test the rest.**

Worked example (Kmart Group VDP): subfinder returned **201** subdomains for the in-scope apex.
Of those, **76** were clearly non-production (`dev`, `dev2`, `sit`, `uat`, `sandpit`,
`nonprod`, `*-dev.apim`, `supplier-testing`) and the program's scope said only "production".
They were enumerated passively and **never actively tested** — say so explicitly in the report,
because it is a deliberate authorisation decision, not an oversight.

Also check for **cross-country endpoints hardcoded in the client bundle**: the AU bundle
contained `api.kmart.co.nz`, and the program explicitly excluded "stores in other countries".
That host was never contacted.

Practical triage of a subdomain list against a production-only scope:

| Pattern | Treat as |
|---|---|
| the exact URL(s) the scope names, plus the assets the app itself loads | in scope |
| `www.` / apex of the named domain, same production app | in scope |
| anything containing `dev`, `uat`, `sit`, `sandpit`, `nonprod`, `test`, `staging`, `qa` | **out of scope** unless named — enumerate passively, do not test |
| a different country's TLD or host (`api.*.co.nz` when scope is AU) | out of scope — do not contact |
| admin / supplier / contractor portals on the same apex | ambiguous: they are not "the online store" the scope describes. Ask or leave them, and record the decision |

### 9.3 The VDP usually states the signup identity
Programs commonly say "for account sign-ups please use your Bugcrowd email address". Use the
`@BC_ALIAS.com` alias (§7.1), and note it in "Notes for triagers". If the signup form
never mounts, that is an environment blocker to report — not a reason to invent an account.

### 9.4 Environment blockers belong in the report as coverage, not as a result
If the API host is unreachable, say exactly that and give the access matrix. A VDP report that
reads "no findings" while the account/cart/checkout surface was never reached is a false
negative that also looks like a claim of coverage. See `waf-stateful-bypass` →
`skills/security/waf-stateful-bypass/references/kmart-akamai-multilayer-case.md` for the matrix format.

## 10. Pairing with Other Skills

| For this question / task | Use this skill |
|---|---|
| "Should I report this finding at all?" | `triage-validation` (7-Question Gate) |
| "What's the report body template for Bugcrowd?" | `report-writing` |
| "What VRT do I pick?" | This skill (`bugcrowd-reporting`) §1 |
| "How do I argue for higher severity?" | This skill §2-3 |
| "How do I rebut an OOS objection?" | This skill §4 |
| "How do I redact cookies / PII in screenshots?" | `evidence-hygiene` |
| "Where do I find the payload for this exploitation step?" | `security-arsenal` |
| "Where do I find recon probes for this asset class?" | `offensive-osint` |

## Notes on usage

This skill is small and focused. It does NOT duplicate content from `report-writing` (per-platform templates, CVSS scoring, downgrade counters, 60-second pre-submit checklist) — load both skills together when filing a Bugcrowd report. The two skills' content composes naturally because their boundaries are clean: `report-writing` is the body templates, `bugcrowd-reporting` is the program-specific tactics layered on top.

---

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`report-writing`** — Always load this skill alongside `bugcrowd-reporting`. Workflow primitive: `report-writing` provides the body skeleton; this skill layers VRT selection + severity-request paragraph + OOS-clause rebuttals on top of that skeleton.
- **`triage-validation`** — When deciding if a Bugcrowd-bound finding will pass triage. Workflow primitive: 7Q gate runs first; only validated findings reach this skill for VRT mapping.
- **`evidence-hygiene`** — When attaching screenshots / HARs to a Bugcrowd submission. Workflow primitive: Bugcrowd's private attachment system requires redacted evidence; route everything through `evidence-hygiene` before clicking attach.
- **`security-arsenal`** — When the PoC step needs payloads cited verbatim. Workflow primitive: the "Steps to Reproduce" section in this skill's report bodies pulls exact payloads from `security-arsenal` so the triager can paste-and-run.
- **`bb-methodology`** — When confirming engagement mode is bug-bounty (not red-team). Workflow primitive: PART 0 of `bb-methodology` answers "bug bounty?"; if yes AND the target is Bugcrowd, this skill becomes the reporting overlay.
