## 7. External Red-Team Recon Pipeline

A 5-stage pipeline for any authorized external assessment. Stages are sequential; modules within a stage can run concurrently.

### Stage 1 — Seed Discovery
Establish the ground truth of who/what the target is.

- WHOIS on the seed domain (registrant, dates, name servers).
- ASN enumeration: which AS does the org own/use? (Hurricane Electric BGP Toolkit, RIPEstat, BGPView.)
- DNS records (A/AAAA/MX/TXT/NS/SOA/CAA) — records-only, no walking yet.
- Certificate Transparency history for the root domain (crt.sh, Censys).

### Stage 2 — Asset Expansion
Discover everything that might belong to the target.

- Subdomain enumeration (passive sources first: crt.sh, VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, Shodan, then permutations and bruteforce).
- Cloud bucket enumeration (S3/GCS/Azure permutations from company name + subdomain stems — see §15).
- Typosquat domain generation (dnstwist variants → resolve → WHOIS) — for both phishing risk and adjacent corp assets.
- Wayback CDX archive endpoints for forgotten paths.
- Mobile app discovery (Android via google-play-scraper, iOS via iTunes Search API — see §14).
- DNS deep walking (NSEC walk on misconfigured zones, AXFR opportunism).
- LinkedIn employee enumeration → email-pattern derivation.

### Stage 3 — Enrichment
Add depth to the discovered assets.

- Port + service detection (Shodan InternetDB free → naabu/masscan if authorized).
- Live TLS handshakes (cert chain, JARM, favicon mmh3 hash).
- Web tech detection (Wappalyzer-style ~600 signatures via httpx).
- WAF/CDN inference (header markers).
- Origin discovery if behind CDN (see §27).
- Security header audit.
- Bulk screenshots (triage 1000s of hosts visually).
- Email harvesting (6 parallel sources).
- Email security audit (SPF/DMARC/DKIM/BIMI/MTA-STS).
- GitHub code-search dorking (13 dork templates × 29+ secret regexes).
- JavaScript deep analysis (sourcemaps, secrets, endpoints, internal-host leakage).
- SSO/IdP tenant fingerprinting (Entra, Okta, ADFS, Google, SAML, M365 Teams/SharePoint/OAuth — see §11).
- API & auth-map discovery (Swagger/OpenAPI, GraphQL, Postman).
- Secrets-beyond-GitHub sweep (Postman public workspaces, Stack Exchange, Trello/Notion/Atlassian dorks).
- Vendor product fingerprinting (Citrix/F5/PaloAlto/Pulse/Fortinet/Cisco/VMware/Exchange).
- Container / CI-CD / cloud-native exposure check.
- Job posting harvest for tech-stack inference.

### Stage 4 — Exposure Analysis
Convert assets into findings.

- Nuclei (15 always-on built-in checks + optional binary).
- TLS deep audit (sslyze / testssl.sh).
- Breach × identity correlation (HudsonRock Cavalier, HIBP, DeHashed, IntelX, local corpus → SSO_EXPOSURE findings).
- Targeted misconfiguration probes (`.git/config`, `.env`, `phpinfo.php`, `/actuator/env`, `/actuator/heapdump`, `_cat/indices`, `/console`, `/manager/html`).
- Vulnerability prioritization (CVE × EPSS × CISA KEV × public-POC availability — see §28).

### Stage 5 — Reporting
Make the work usable.

- Risk scoring per finding (CVSS + program-specific weights).
- Asset graph export (D3-friendly nodes/links, GraphML, JSON).
- Client-facing report (executive summary + technical detail + remediation — see §31).
- Reproduction package (run_id, tool versions, raw evidence, JSONL log).
- Bug bounty submission (if applicable — see §30).

### 7.5 Pipeline Priority Order (highest signal density first)

When budget is constrained, work in this order:

1. **Breaches** — infostealer logs (HudsonRock Cavalier free tier) + HIBP + DeHashed. Highest ROI for red teams; often gives valid plaintext creds for corp SSO. Requires emails as input.
2. **GitHub recon** — code-search dorks. Finds AWS keys, Slack tokens, JWT secrets, `.env` files. Fastest path to cloud pivot.
3. **Nuclei misconfig sweep** — exposed admin panels, CVEs with public POCs.
4. **Cloud buckets** — permutate company name + subdomain stems. Listable bucket = CRITICAL.
5. **Ports** — Shodan InternetDB first (free, keyless). VPN concentrators, RDP, Jenkins, GitLab-CE, Elasticsearch are the high-value pivot points.
6. **Email OSINT** — feeds breaches; feeds phishing list.
7. **Web tech / WAF / screenshots** — triage thousands of hosts; know the stack before probing.
8. **Wayback** — archived JS often has hard-coded keys; archived endpoints reveal removed admin/dev paths.
9. **DNS deep + email security** — SPF/DMARC gaps enable email spoofing; TXT verification tokens reveal SaaS tenancies.
10. **Certificates** — CT-log timeline catches forgotten subdomains; weak ciphers = cheap findings.
11. **ASN + reverse DNS** — corporate IP space hosts unadvertised infra.
12. **WHOIS** — registrant PII reveals adjacent corp assets.
13. **Typosquat** — actively-registered squats are findings; unregistered ones go on the phishing-domain shortlist.
14. **Security headers** — low standalone value but required for client reports.

### 7.6 Time Budgeting & Engagement Profiles

Stage and asset count drive how long a recon takes. Rough estimates (single operator on a typical SaaS-style target):

| Stage | Small org (<100 employees) | Medium (100–1K) | Large (1K+) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Seed discovery | 30 min | 30 min | 30 min |
| 2. Asset expansion | 1–2 h | 2–4 h | 4–8 h |
| 3. Enrichment (per 100 alive webapps) | ~1 h | ~1 h | ~1 h |
| 4. Exposure analysis | 1–3 h | 3–6 h | 6–12 h |
| 5. Reporting | 2–4 h | 4–8 h | 1–2 days |

**Engagement profiles:**

- **1-hour rapid recon ("how exposed is X?")** — Stage 1 (15 min) → passive subdomain (crt.sh + Subfinder, 10 min) → Shodan InternetDB on resolved IPs (5 min) → email harvest via Hunter+IntelX (10 min) → breach lookup on emails (10 min) → executive-summary-only output (10 min).
- **4-hour focused recon ("phish-readiness check")** — adds: full email harvest, LinkedIn employee enum, SPF/DMARC analysis, typosquat candidate generation, SSO/IdP fingerprinting. Output: phishing-feasibility report + target email list.
- **1-day standard recon** — full Stages 1–4 with the priority order above. Output: per-asset finding list + asset graph + exec summary.
- **1-week deep recon** — all of standard, plus: deep-mode user enumeration, JS deep analysis at full budget, mobile attack surface, cloud-native fingerprinting, vendor product fingerprinting, package registry leak hunting, vulnerability prioritization. Output: full client deliverable package + reproduction bundle.
- **Ongoing monitoring (weekly diff)** — re-run Stages 1–3 weekly; diff against baseline; alert on new asset / new finding / asset disappeared.

**When to abort early:**
- After Stage 1 if scope is wrong (target turns out to be subsidiary of unrelated corp; rules of engagement need clarification).
- After Stage 2 if attack surface is below threshold (no public webapps + no exposed services + no leaked emails → little to find externally).
- During any stage if you hit the WAF / detection signs in §6.4.
