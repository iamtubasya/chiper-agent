Recon Data Management
Running tools is easy. Dealing with the output isn't. A recon pipeline across 50 programs generates gigabytes of text files fast. Without a strategy for storing, querying, and deduplicating that data, you end up with a pile of flat files you can't query efficiently and no reliable way to detect what's new. This page covers how to manage recon output at scale.
The Problems with Flat Files
The naive approach: run subfinder, pipe to a text file, grep when you need something. This works for one target. It breaks down when:

You're running the same tools against 50 programs
You want to find all live hosts across all programs running a specific technology
You need to know which subdomains are new since yesterday
You want to correlate a new CVE against your existing port scan data

Flat files don't support relational queries. When you need "show me all hosts running Apache 2.4.49 across all my programs," you need a database.
Storage Architecture
For most researchers at scale, SQLite is enough. It's zero-config, file-based, portable, and handles millions of rows without breaking a sweat. Move to PostgreSQL only when you have multiple machines writing to the same DB or you're storing hundreds of millions of rows.
-- Core schema for recon data
 
CREATE TABLE programs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    platform TEXT,   -- hackerone, bugcrowd, intigriti
    added_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
 
CREATE TABLE subdomains (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    program_id INTEGER REFERENCES programs(id),
    subdomain TEXT NOT NULL,
    first_seen DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_seen DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_live INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    resolved_ip TEXT,
    UNIQUE(program_id, subdomain)
);

Inserting Data: Parsing Tool Output
Most tools support JSON output. Parse it programmatically instead of grepping text.
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sqlite3
import sys
from datetime import datetime
 
def insert_httpx_output(db_path, program_id, httpx_json_file):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cur = conn.cursor()
 
    with open(httpx_json_file) as f:
        for line in f:
            try:
                record = json.loads(line.strip())
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                continue
 
            subdomain = record.get('host', '').split(':')[0]
            url = record.get('url', '')
            status = record.get('status-code', 0)
            title = record.get('title', '')
            tech = json.dumps(record.get('tech', []))
            content_length = record.get('content-length', 0)
            resolved_ip = record.get('a', [None])[0] if record.get('a') else None
 
            # Upsert subdomain
            cur.execute("""
                INSERT INTO subdomains (program_id, subdomain, is_live, resolved_ip, last_seen)
                VALUES (?, ?, 1, ?, ?)
                ON CONFLICT(program_id, subdomain) DO UPDATE SET
                    is_live=1, resolved_ip=excluded.resolved_ip, last_seen=excluded.last_seen
            """, (program_id, subdomain, resolved_ip, datetime.now()))
 
            sub_id = cur.execute(
                "SELECT id FROM subdomains WHERE program_id=? AND subdomain=?",
                (program_id, subdomain)
            ).fetchone()[0]
 
            # Upsert http service
            cur.execute("""
                INSERT INTO http_services (subdomain_id, url, status_code, title, tech, content_length, last_seen)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
                ON CONFLICT(subdomain_id, url) DO UPDATE SET
                    status_code=excluded.status_code, title=excluded.title,
                    tech=excluded.tech, last_seen=excluded.last_seen
            """, (sub_id, url, status, title, tech, content_length, datetime.now()))
 
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

    insert_httpx_output(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2]), sys.argv[3])
Delta Detection: Querying for New Findings
The whole point of storing data over time is detecting what changed. Query for new assets found since the last check.
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
 
def get_new_subdomains(db_path, program_id, hours=24):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cur = conn.cursor()
 
    cutoff = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=hours)
 
    results = cur.execute("""
        SELECT subdomain, resolved_ip, first_seen
        FROM subdomains
        WHERE program_id = ?
          AND first_seen > ?
          AND is_live = 1
        ORDER BY first_seen DESC
    """, (program_id, cutoff)).fetchall()
 
    conn.close()
    return results
 
def get_new_http_services(db_path, program_id, hours=24):
    """New HTTP services -- interesting: might be a newly deployed app"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cutoff = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=hours)
 
    return cur.execute("""
        SELECT h.url, h.status_code, h.title, h.tech, s.subdomain
        FROM http_services h
        JOIN subdomains s ON h.subdomain_id = s.id
        WHERE s.program_id = ?
          AND h.last_seen > ?
        ORDER BY h.last_seen DESC
    """, (program_id, cutoff)).fetchall()
Deduplication
Deduplication happens at multiple levels. Get it wrong and you either miss bugs (over-dedup) or drown in noise (under-dedup).
def deduplicate_subdomains(sub_list):
    """Remove exact duplicates and obvious wildcard responses"""
    seen = set()
    deduplicated = []
 
    for sub in sub_list:
        # Normalize: lowercase, strip trailing dot
        normalized = sub.strip().lower().rstrip('.')
        if normalized and normalized not in seen:
            seen.add(normalized)
            deduplicated.append(normalized)
 
    return deduplicated
 
 
def filter_wildcard_ips(subdomains_with_ips, threshold=10):
    """
    If more than `threshold` subdomains resolve to the same IP,
    that IP is likely a wildcard sinkhole. Filter it out.
    """
    from collections import Counter
    ip_counts = Counter(ip for _, ip in subdomains_with_ips if ip)
    wildcard_ips = {ip for ip, count in ip_counts.items() if count > threshold}
 
    return [
        (sub, ip) for sub, ip in subdomains_with_ips
        if ip not in wildcard_ips
    ]
Querying at Scale
Useful queries once you have data:
-- All live hosts across all programs running a specific tech
SELECT s.subdomain, h.url, h.tech, p.name as program
FROM http_services h
JOIN subdomains s ON h.subdomain_id = s.id
JOIN programs p ON s.program_id = p.id
WHERE h.tech LIKE '%Apache%'
  AND s.is_live = 1;
 
-- Programs with the most new subdomains in last 7 days
SELECT p.name, COUNT(*) as new_subs
FROM subdomains s
JOIN programs p ON s.program_id = p.id
WHERE s.first_seen > datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY new_subs DESC;
 
-- Open ports by service across all targets
SELECT protocol, service, COUNT(*) as count
FROM ports
GROUP BY protocol, service
ORDER BY count DESC;
 
-- Find all hosts with port 9200 open (Elasticsearch)
SELECT s.subdomain, p.ip, p.port, p.banner, prog.name
FROM ports p
JOIN subdomains s ON p.subdomain_id = s.id
JOIN programs prog ON s.program_id = prog.id
WHERE p.port = 9200;
File Organization (When You Still Need Files)
For raw tool output you're not yet importing to the DB:
recon/
  target.com/
    2024-01-15/         ← date-stamped runs
      subs/
        subfinder.txt
        amass.txt
        all_subs.txt
        live_subs.txt
      http/
        httpx.json
        live_urls.txt
      ports/
        masscan.json
        nmap/
      content/
        admin.example.com.json
        api.example.com.json
      js/
        urls.txt
        endpoints.txt
        secrets.txt
    latest -> 2024-01-15/   ← symlink to most recent run
The symlink to latest means scripts can always reference ./target.com/latest/ without knowing the current date.
