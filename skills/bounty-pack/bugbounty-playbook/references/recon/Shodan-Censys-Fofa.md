Shodan, Censys & FOFA
Three organisations have spent years scanning every routable IP on the internet, recording banners, parsing TLS certificates, and indexing what they found. Their databases are a recon shortcut that no amount of active scanning can replicate cheaply. The question isn't whether to use them  -  it's knowing the right query syntax and which engine answers which question fastest.

Shodan
Shodan is the oldest and most widely known internet scan database. Its query syntax is compact and its data includes banner grabs, HTTP responses, favicons, and TLS cert metadata.
Core Query Syntax
# Everything in an org's netblock
org:"Target Inc"
 
# All hosts serving a cert with target.com in the SAN
ssl:"target.com"
 
# Specific product version  -  good for finding unpatched instances
product:"Apache httpd" version:"2.4.49"
 
# HTTP title match  -  catches admin panels and internal tools
http.title:"Admin Panel"
http.title:"Jenkins"
http.title:"Kibana"
http.title:"Grafana"
 
# Combine them
org:"Target Inc" http.title:"Admin"
ssl:"target.com" product:"nginx" port:8443
Favicon Hash Dorks
Favicons rarely change between environments. If you hash the production favicon, you can find every host serving the same app  -  including staging instances with no DNS record.
Computing the hash:
import mmh3
import requests
import base64
 
def favicon_hash(url):
    r = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    favicon = base64.encodebytes(r.content)
    return mmh3.hash(favicon)
 
# Usage
hash_val = favicon_hash("target.com/favicon.ico")
print(f"http.favicon.hash:{hash_val}")
# http.favicon.hash:-1234567890
# Install dependencies
pip install mmh3 requests
 
# Then search Shodan
shodan search 'http.favicon.hash:-1234567890' --fields ip_str,port,org
 
# Common hashes for known panels  -  worth checking on every target
# Jupyter Notebook: http.favicon.hash:1335394149
# phpMyAdmin:       http.favicon.hash:1531044888
# Grafana:          http.favicon.hash:-939714854
Shodan CLI
# Install
pip install shodan
 
# Set API key
shodan init YOUR_API_KEY
 
# Search and output as JSON
shodan search --fields ip_str,port,org,product 'org:"Target Inc"' > shodan_results.json
 
# Count results before downloading
shodan count 'ssl:"target.com"'
 
# Get all info about a specific IP
shodan host 203.0.113.42
 
# Download full result set (uses credits)
shodan download target_results 'org:"Target Inc"'
shodan parse --fields ip_str,port,product target_results.json.gz
High-Value Shodan Dorks
# Exposed internal services

org:"Target Inc" port:9200 product:"Elastic"  # Elasticsearch
org:"Target Inc" port:6379 product:"Redis"
org:"Target Inc" port:5432 product:"PostgreSQL"
 
# Development environments
org:"Target Inc" http.title:"staging"
org:"Target Inc" ssl.cert.subject.cn:"*.staging.target.com"
 
# Cloud metadata  -  exposed instances with interesting banners
org:"Target Inc" http.html:"X-Amz-Request-Id"
 
# Default credentials / login pages
org:"Target Inc" http.html:"admin" http.status:200

Censys
Censys runs its own scan infrastructure and indexes differently from Shodan. Its certificate data is richer, and the query language (Censys Query Language) is more structured.
Censys Query Syntax
# Requires API key or web UI
# Install CLI
pip install censys
 
# Hosts with target.com in TLS cert
censys search 'services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.names: target.com' --index hosts
 
# Services on a specific port with banner match
censys search 'services.port=9200 and services.service_name=ELASTICSEARCH' --index hosts
 
# Filter by autonomous system
censys search 'autonomous_system.name="TARGET INC"' --index hosts
 
# Full text search across HTTP responses
censys search 'services.http.response.body="target.com" and services.port=443' --index hosts
# CLI usage
censys view --index hosts 203.0.113.42
censys search 'services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject.organization="Target Inc"' \
  --index hosts --pages 5 | jq -r '.ip' | sort -u > censys_ips.txt

FOFA
FOFA is a Chinese internet scan engine operated by Baimaohui. Its data coverage skews heavily towards Asia-Pacific infrastructure  -  when a target operates in China, Japan, Korea, or Southeast Asia, FOFA often surfaces hosts that Shodan and Censys miss entirely.
FOFA Query Syntax
# Basic domain search  -  finds hosts serving the domain in any context
domain="target.com"
 
# Body content match
body="target.com" && title="login"
body="Powered by Target Inc"
 
# Header search
header="X-Target-Version"
header="Server: Target-Custom/1.2"
 
# Certificate
cert="target.com"
cert.subject="Target Inc"
 
# IP range
ip="203.0.113.0/24"
 
# Combine  -  FOFA uses && and ||
domain="target.com" && country="CN"
cert="target.com" && port="8443"
# FOFA API  -  returns base64-encoded results
API_KEY="your_fofa_key"
EMAIL="your@email.com"
QUERY=$(echo -n 'domain="target.com"' | base64)
 
curl -s "fofa.info/api/v1/search/all${EMAIL}&key=${API_KEY}&qbase64=${QUERY}&fields=ip,port,host,title,country&size=1000" | \
  jq -r '.results[] | @tsv'
When to Use FOFA

Target has operations in China, Japan, or South-East Asia
Shodan shows sparse results for a large org  -  FOFA may have different scan timing
Looking for Asia-Pacific CDN or hosting providers
Searching for Chinese-language admin panels on international targets


ZoomEye
ZoomEye is another Chinese internet scan engine. Narrower feature set than FOFA but worth a quick check.
# Web-only: zoomeye.org
# Query syntax similar to Shodan
# app:"nginx" +site:target.com
# service:"http" +site:target.com +country:"CN"

Practical Tips
Don't trust rate limits. Free Shodan searches return 100 results max. If shodan count shows 2,400 results, you need API credits or a creative narrowing strategy.
Export and diff. Run these searches at the start of a target and again two weeks later. New hosts appearing in Shodan often mean a new deployment  -  and those deployments are frequently the ones with misconfigurations from a rushed launch.
Cross-reference with ASN data. If your ASN Mapping work found three CIDRs, restrict your Shodan/Censys queries to those ranges to cut noise significantly.
