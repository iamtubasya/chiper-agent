Tech Fingerprinting
Knowing the stack isn't a nice-to-have. It's how you decide which of the 50 live hosts in your recon output is worth testing first. A host running Struts 2.5.10 is a different conversation than a host running a modern Go microservice. Fingerprinting gives you that triage signal before you touch the app.

httpx  -  Fast First Pass
httpx with -tech-detect runs Wappalyzer's detection engine against every response in one shot. Run it across your full live host list.
# Tech detection across all live hosts
httpx -l live_hosts.txt \
  -tech-detect \
  -title \
  -status-code \
  -content-length \
  -server \
  -silent \
  -o tech_results.json \
  -json
 
# Parse out just the tech field
cat tech_results.json | jq -r '[.url, (.technologies // [] | join(", "))] | @tsv'
 
# Filter for specific stacks worth investigating
cat tech_results.json | jq -r 'select(.technologies[]? | test("WordPress|Drupal|Laravel|Struts")) | .url'
 
# Example output shape:
# api.target.com          Spring Boot, Java, Apache Tomcat
# blog.target.com         WordPress 6.1, PHP 8.0, MySQL
# legacy.target.com       PHP 5.6, Apache 2.2  <-- interesting

whatweb
whatweb does active fingerprinting and returns more granular version data than httpx in many cases.
# Single target
whatweb target.com -v
 
# File of targets
whatweb -i live_hosts.txt --log-brief=whatweb_results.txt
 
# Aggressive mode  -  more requests, more detail
whatweb target.com -a 3
 
# Output JSON for parsing
whatweb target.com -a 3 --log-json=whatweb.json
 
# Example output:
# target.com [200 OK] Apache[2.4.41], Bootstrap[4.5.2],
#   Cookies[PHPSESSID], Country[US], HTTPServer[Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)],
#   IP[203.0.113.42], PHP[7.4.3], Title[Target Inc - Dashboard]

Wappalyzer CLI
# Install
npm install -g wappalyzer
 
# Analyse a URL
wappalyzer target.com --pretty
 
# Output shape:
# {
#   "urls": { "target.com/": { "status": 200 } },
#   "technologies": [
#     { "name": "React", "version": "18.2.0", "categories": ["JavaScript frameworks"] },
#     { "name": "Webpack", "version": "", "categories": ["Miscellaneous"] },
#     { "name": "Nginx", "version": "1.20.1", "categories": ["Web servers"] }
#   ]
# }

Header Fingerprinting
Response headers leak stack information even when a site tries to hide it.
# Grab headers from a host
curl -sI target.com | grep -iE "(server|x-powered-by|x-aspnet-version|x-generator|via|x-cache|cf-ray|x-amz|x-goog)"
 
# Interesting header patterns:
# Server: Apache/2.4.41  -  direct version disclosure
# X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.3  -  direct PHP version
# X-Powered-By: ASP.NET  -  .NET without version (hardened)
# Via: 1.1 vegur  -  Heroku
# X-Served-By: cache-syd10125-SYD  -  Fastly CDN
# CF-Ray: 7abc123-SYD  -  Cloudflare
# X-Amz-Request-Id:  -  AWS origin
# X-Amz-Cf-Id:  -  CloudFront
 
# CDN indicator: important because WAF is likely present too
# Check if origin is reachable directly (bypasses WAF)
curl -sI https://203.0.113.42 -H "Host: target.com"

Nuclei Technology Templates
Nuclei has a dedicated technology detection template library that catches specific versions and misconfigurations.
# Run all technology detection templates
nuclei -l live_hosts.txt \
  -t http/technologies/ \
  -silent \
  -o nuclei_tech.txt
 
# Specific tech categories
nuclei -l live_hosts.txt \
  -t http/technologies/wordpress/ \
  -o nuclei_wp.txt
 
nuclei -l live_hosts.txt \
  -t http/technologies/spring/ \
  -t http/technologies/java/ \
  -o nuclei_java.txt
 
# Exposed panels and admin interfaces
nuclei -l live_hosts.txt \
  -t http/exposed-panels/ \
  -silent \
  -o exposed_panels.txt

Favicon Hashing for Tech Detection
Same technique as in Shodan Censys Fofa  -  the hash identifies the framework or product, not just the company.
# Known hashes  -  check against your targets
# Jenkins:      http.favicon.hash:81586312
# Grafana:      http.favicon.hash:-939714854
# Kibana:       http.favicon.hash:-1438785029
# phpMyAdmin:   http.favicon.hash:1531044888
# Jupyter:      http.favicon.hash:1335394149
# GitLab:       http.favicon.hash:1278323681
# Jira:         http.favicon.hash:-1399890347
 
# Compute a hash from a live target's favicon
python3 -c "
import mmh3, requests, base64
r = requests.get('target.com/favicon.ico', timeout=10)
h = mmh3.hash(base64.encodebytes(r.content))
print(f'Favicon hash: {h}')
"

Mapping Tech to CVEs
Once you know the stack, look for known vulnerabilities before spending time on manual testing.
# Search vulners.com via their API
PRODUCT="Apache Tomcat"
VERSION="9.0.56"
curl -s "vulners.com/api/v3/search/lucene/${PRODUCT}+${VERSION}&skip=0&size=10" | \
  jq -r '.data.search[] | [.id, .cvss.score, .title] | @tsv' | sort -t$'\t' -k2 -rn | head -10
 
# Nuclei CVE templates  -  run after you know the tech
nuclei -l live_hosts.txt \
  -t http/cves/ \
  -tags apache,tomcat \
  -silent \
  -o cve_hits.txt
 
# Search for public PoCs on a specific version
# GitHub dork: "CVE-2021-XXXX" "Apache Tomcat 9.0.56"

Common Pitfalls
Version headers can lie. Some ops teams change Server: headers to mislead scanners. whatweb's full response analysis  -  parsing JS library versions from HTML  -  is often more reliable than a single header.
CDN masking. If Cloudflare or Akamai is in the path, the tech stack you see is the CDN's, not the origin's. Use Shodan Censys Fofa to find the real origin IP and probe that directly.
Don't nuclei-blast without calibrating. Run nuclei -l hosts.txt -t http/technologies/ -stats first to see volume. On a target with 400 live hosts, a full CVE template run will generate noise  -  filter by relevant technology tags.
