ASN Mapping
Most hunters start with a domain name. ASN mapping starts with a company name and works down to raw IP space  -  blocks of addresses that host infrastructure without any DNS entry pointing at them. These are the assets nobody else is testing because they never show up in subdomain enumeration.

Why DNS Isn't Enough
Subdomain enumeration finds what's in DNS. IP ranges contain what's on the network. Dev boxen, internal-facing services accidentally reachable from the internet, acquired infrastructure still on the old network, staging environments with no DNS record. A company can have hundreds of live IPs with open HTTP ports and zero publicly registered hostnames. ASN mapping finds those.

Step 1: Company Name to ASN
BGPView  -  Start Here
# Web API  -  no key required
curl -s "api.bgpview.io/search+Inc" | \
  jq '.data.asns[] | {asn: .asn, name: .name, description: .description}'
 
# Example output shape:
# {
#   "asn": 12345,
#   "name": "TARGET-INC",
#   "description": "Target Inc, US"
# }
metabigor
# Install
go install github.com/j3ssie/metabigor@latest
 
# Org name to ASN
echo "Target Inc" | metabigor net --org -o asns.txt
 
# Output shape:
# AS12345 | TARGET-INC | Target Inc
# AS67890 | TARGET-CDN | Target content delivery
amass intel
# amass has a built-in org lookup that returns ASNs
amass intel -org "Target Inc" -o amass_asns.txt
 
# Also works with -asn to expand from a known ASN
amass intel -asn 12345 -o amass_prefixes.txt
asnlookup
# asnlookup.com  -  paste-friendly web UI or API
curl -s "asnlookup.com/api/lookup+Inc" | \
  jq '.[] | {asn: .asn, cidr: .cidr}'

Step 2: ASN to CIDR Ranges
Once you have one or more ASNs, pull all the IP prefixes they announce.
# BGPView  -  most reliable for this
ASN=12345
curl -s "api.bgpview.io/asn/AS${ASN}/prefixes" | \
  jq -r '.data.ipv4_prefixes[].prefix' > cidr_ranges.txt
 
# Output shape:
# 203.0.113.0/24
# 198.51.100.0/22
# 192.0.2.0/23
 
# Combine multiple ASNs
for asn in 12345 67890 11111; do
  curl -s "api.bgpview.io/asn/AS${asn}/prefixes" | \
    jq -r '.data.ipv4_prefixes[].prefix'
done | sort -u > all_cidrs.txt
 
wc -l all_cidrs.txt
# 14 all_cidrs.txt
whoisxmlapi
Useful when the company name has noise  -  it does fuzzy matching and returns structured WHOIS data for each prefix.
curl -s "www.whoisxmlapi.com/whoisserver/WhoisService | \
  jq '.WhoisRecord.registryData'

Step 3: Feed CIDRs Into Port Scanners
This is the payoff. Scan the IP space directly.
# masscan  -  fast sweep across a /22
# Requires root or cap_net_raw
masscan -iL all_cidrs.txt \
  -p80,443,8080,8443,8888,3000,4000,5000,9000,9443,22,21,25 \
  --rate=5000 \
  -oJ asn_masscan.json
 
# naabu  -  lower noise alternative, integrates with nmap
cat all_cidrs.txt | naabu -top-ports 1000 -o naabu_open.txt
 
# httpx on discovered open web ports
cat naabu_open.txt | httpx -silent -title -status-code -tech-detect \
  -o asn_web_hosts.txt

Reading the Results
The IPs you find fall into a few buckets:

Live web service, no hostname - probe with httpx, screenshot with gowitness, look for admin panels, internal tools, and dev environments
Resolves to a known subdomain - confirms scope, less interesting
Resolves to an unknown subdomain - add it to your subdomain list, it was never in DNS enumeration
Ports open but no HTTP - check for SSH, FTP, SMTP, database ports depending on program scope

# Find IPs with open ports that have no PTR record (no reverse DNS)
# These are your most likely "forgotten" assets
while read ip; do
  ptr=$(dig +short -x "$ip" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -z "$ptr" ]; then
    echo "No PTR: $ip"
  fi
done < discovered_ips.txt

ASN Mapping Workflow
graph TD
    A[Company Name] --> B[BGPView / metabigor search]
    A --> C[amass intel -org]
    B --> D[ASN list]
    C --> D
    D --> E[BGPView  -  ASN to CIDR prefixes]
    E --> F[all_cidrs.txt]
    F --> G[masscan  -  fast port sweep]
    G --> H[naabu + httpx  -  web service probe]
    H --> I[IPs with no PTR record]
    H --> J[IPs with unexpected services]
    I --> K[Manual investigation]
    J --> K


Common Pitfalls
CDN inflation: Large companies use Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly. Their ASN lookup may return CDN ranges, not company ranges. Cross-reference multiple ASNs and discard obvious CDN providers.
Shared hosting: /24 ranges don't always mean the whole block belongs to the target. Confirm ownership with WHOIS on individual IPs before spending time on them.
Rate limiting: BGPView and similar APIs rate-limit aggressively. Cache your results  -  there's no point re-fetching the same ASN prefix list every run.

Port Scanning  -  after you have CIDRs, this is the next step
Acquisitions  -  acquired companies often retain their original ASNs
Subdomain Enumeration  -  correlate ASN IPs against your subdomain list
Cloud Range Discovery  -  some cloud IPs fall outside standard ASN lookups
