Mobile Attack Surface
The app binary is a goldmine. Hardcoded secrets, API endpoints, internal hostnames, encryption keys, AWS credentials - all sitting in a file you can download from the App Store or APK mirror. Most hunters skip mobile because it feels like more setup. That's why the bugs persist.
The important mental shift: the mobile app itself is secondary. What matters is what the app reveals and how it talks to the backend. The real bugs are almost always in the backend API. The app just gives you the map.

Why Mobile is Worth Your Time

The app binary ships with secrets devs never meant to expose. Firebase config, AWS keys, third-party API keys, internal API base URLs, hardcoded credentials.
Backend APIs built for mobile often skip the rate limiting and input validation that the web API has. They're "for trusted apps only."
Deep links are an underexplored attack surface. They let any app on the device trigger actions in your target app. A crafted deep link can pre-fill forms, trigger OAuth flows, skip confirmation screens.
Certificate pinning gets added and then never tested. Frida bypasses it in two minutes.

Setup You Actually Need
Android:
- Android Studio (for emulator) or physical device
- jadx (decompile APK to Java)
- apktool (repack/patch APKs)
- Frida + frida-server on device
- Burp Suite (proxy)
- adb
iOS:
- Jailbroken device (checkra1n, palera1n) or simulator for static analysis
- Frida
- objection (Frida wrapper with built-in hooks)
- class-dump or frida-ios-dump for class headers
- ipatool or Apple Configurator for IPA download
- Burp Suite (proxy)
Where to Get the App Binary
# Android - multiple options
apkeep -a com.target.app -d google-play .   # apkeep tool
# Or download APK directly from apkpure.com, apkmirror.com
 
# iOS - requires a device or paid tooling
# ipatool (requires Apple ID, app must be in your purchase history or free)
ipatool download -b com.target.app --output target.ipa
 
# From a jailbroken device after installing the app
frida-ios-dump -u mobile -H 127.0.0.1 com.target.app
Sub-Pages

Android Testing - APK decompilation, hardcoded secrets, deep links, cert pinning bypass
iOS Testing - IPA analysis, keychain, URL schemes, universal links
Shared Mobile Concerns - API extraction via proxy, deep link to ATO chains, push notification abuse

Quick Wins Without a Device
Static analysis alone can net you real bugs. Before you even set up a proxy:

Download the APK/IPA
Run strings and grep for secrets (api_key, secret, password, AWS_, firebase)
Decompile and search for URLs - you'll find internal API endpoints
Check the manifest (Android) or Info.plist (iOS) for URL schemes and exported components
Check for .git, debug endpoints, staging URLs hardcoded for dev builds that made it to prod
