Race Conditions
Race conditions in web apps are TOCTOU bugs at the HTTP layer  -  the app checks state, then acts on it, and there's a window between the two where you can sneak in a duplicate operation. The window is often measured in microseconds. Modern tooling  -  specifically the single-packet attack  -  makes exploiting those windows reliable.
The Core Pattern
sequenceDiagram
    participant T1 as Thread 1
    participant T2 as Thread 2
    participant DB as Database

    T1->>DB: SELECT balance = $100
    T2->>DB: SELECT balance = $100
    Note over DB: Both threads read $100 before either writes
    T1->>DB: UPDATE balance=0, transfer $100
    T2->>DB: UPDATE balance=0, transfer $100
    Note over DB: $200 transferred from $100 balance

The app reads state, decides what's allowed, then writes. If two requests hit the read phase simultaneously, both see the "correct" state and both proceed  -  the check fires twice but the enforcement only works once.
The Single-Packet Attack
Sending requests "simultaneously" over TCP doesn't work  -  network jitter means one arrives before the other. The single-packet attack solves this by batching multiple HTTP/1.1 requests into a single TCP packet, or using HTTP/2 multiplexing to send multiple streams in one frame. The server receives all requests at essentially the same instant.
Burp's Repeater has a "Send group (parallel)" option that does this  -  select multiple tabs, use the parallel send mode.
Using Turbo Intruder
# turbo-intruder race.py  -  coupon reuse test
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=1,
                           requestsPerConnection=20,
                           pipeline=True)
 
    # Send 20 requests simultaneously
    for i in range(20):
        engine.queue(target.req, None)
 
def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
In Turbo Intruder: Extensions > Turbo Intruder, load the script above, select race-single-packet-attack from the examples dropdown. Set concurrentConnections=1 and requestsPerConnection to however many parallel requests you want.
Real Scenarios
Coupon / Promo Code Reuse
POST /checkout/apply-coupon HTTP/1.1
{"code": "SAVE50", "orderId": "abc123"}
Normal flow: apply → validate unused → mark used → apply discount. Race the apply request 10–15 times simultaneously. If the "mark used" write hasn't committed before the other reads check the "is used" state, multiple discounts land.
Turbo Intruder setup: 15 identical requests, single-packet send. Check how many discount line items appear in the final order.
Balance Manipulation / Double Spend
POST /wallet/withdraw HTTP/1.1
{"amount": 100, "destination": "external"}
If balance check and debit aren't atomic (wrapped in a transaction with pessimistic locking), you can withdraw the same balance twice. Test with an amount equal to your full balance. Race two requests  -  if both succeed, you've demonstrated double-spend.
Vote / Like Manipulation
POST /post/1337/vote HTTP/1.1
{"direction": "up"}
Apps that enforce "one vote per user" via application-layer checks (not DB constraints) are vulnerable. Race 20 vote requests  -  check the vote count after. More than 1 increment means the limit isn't atomic.
Rate Limit Bypass
Password reset OTP codes with a rate limit: "3 attempts then lockout." Race 10 guesses simultaneously  -  if all arrive before the counter increments from any of them, you get 10 guesses instead of 3.
Limit Bypass on Feature Usage
POST /api/export HTTP/1.1
{"reportId": "abc"}
Free tier allows 3 exports. Race 6 requests. If the counter check isn't atomic with the increment, you get more than your limit.
Detection Methodology
flowchart TD
    A["Find limit-enforcing endpoints"] --> B["Map TOCTOU window"]
    B --> C{"Check + write atomic?"}
    C -->|"Yes"| D["Hard to exploit, move on"]
    C -->|"No, app-level check"| E["Race with single-packet attack"]
    E --> F{"Multiple successes?"}
    F -->|"Yes"| G["Confirmed race condition"]
    F -->|"No"| H["Try more requests or timing"]

I look for these patterns first: coupon/voucher application, referral code use, "one per user" limits, balance-affecting operations, vote/rating systems, API rate limits enforced in app code.
Burp Suite Setup

Capture the target request
Right-click → Send to Repeater
Duplicate the tab 10-15 times (Ctrl+R, then Ctrl+Shift+R repeatedly)
Select all tabs
Right-click → "Send group (parallel)"  -  uses single-packet HTTP/2

Or use Turbo Intruder for finer control. The Turbo Intruder examples/race.py template is the starting point.
Checklist

 Identify all endpoints that enforce limits, uniqueness, or check before modify
 Determine if checks are application-layer or DB-level (transactions/locks)
 Use Burp parallel send or Turbo Intruder single-packet mode
 Start with 10–15 parallel requests; scale up if needed
 Check for negative balances (negative number = double spend)
 Check for multiple successful uses of single-use codes
 Document exact request count, success count, and resulting state change
