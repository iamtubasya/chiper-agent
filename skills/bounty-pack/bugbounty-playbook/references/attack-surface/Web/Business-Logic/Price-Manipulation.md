Price Manipulation
Payment flows are where developers make the most optimistic assumptions about user behavior. The most common mistake: trusting price data that comes from the client. The second most common: not validating input boundaries (negative values, overflows, absurd quantities). I've gotten critical findings just by changing a price field from 99.99 to -99.99 and watching the app issue me a refund on checkout.
Client-Side Price Trust
The most direct form. Price is calculated client-side and sent in the request body:
POST /checkout HTTP/1.1
 
{"items":[{"sku":"PROD001","qty":1,"price":99.99}],"total":99.99}
Change price to 0.01 or 0. Some backends recalculate  -  those are fine. Some accept whatever price is sent  -  that's a critical bug. The trick is that modern SPAs often pass price in the request even when the backend ignores it, so you have to test empirically.
Also look for price in hidden form fields (classic server-side rendered apps):
<input type="hidden" name="price" value="99.99">
<input type="hidden" name="item_id" value="PROD001">
Intercept with Burp and modify price before the form submits.
Negative Values
POST /api/order HTTP/1.1
{"quantity": -1, "unitPrice": 99.99}
If quantity * unitPrice isn't validated for sign, a negative quantity produces a negative total  -  meaning the app owes you money. The checkout flow may complete and issue a credit or reduce a balance. Same test with negative price:
{"price": -99.99}   → total = -99.99 → store credit applied?
{"discount": 999}   → total goes negative
{"qty": 1, "price": -99.99, "discountedPrice": -99.99}
Integer Overflow
Less common in modern languages with arbitrary precision, but still relevant in:

Go (int32 max: 2,147,483,647)
PHP with certain integer operations
Legacy Java with int instead of BigDecimal
Database columns with INT vs BIGINT

Test with quantity: 2147483648  -  if the backend stores this as a signed 32-bit integer, it wraps to -2147483648. The total price becomes negative.
{"quantity": 2147483648, "unitPrice": 0.01}
→ DB stores: -2147483648 qty
→ Total: -$21474836.48
→ ???
Realistically you're looking for edge cases where large numbers cause unexpected behavior  -  a checkout that errors, produces NaN, or applies a massive unintended discount.
Discount Stacking
Apply the same coupon multiple times. Apply multiple distinct coupons when only one should be allowed. Apply a percentage discount after a fixed discount in an order that changes the calculation:
POST /cart/discount HTTP/1.1
{"code": "FIRST50"}   → -50%
 
POST /cart/discount HTTP/1.1
{"code": "LOYAL10"}   → another -10%
 
POST /cart/discount HTTP/1.1
{"code": "FIRST50"}   → same code again
Some apps track applied discounts client-side only. Others validate server-side but don't check for duplicate codes. Others allow multiple codes but cap the discount  -  find the cap logic by stacking aggressively and looking for where it stops.
Race conditions are relevant here  -  see Race Conditions for coupon reuse via timing.
Currency Conversion Abuse
Apps that support multiple currencies sometimes calculate price conversion inconsistently:

Price is $100 USD
Select currency: JPY → app displays ¥14,800 but processes as $14,800
Or the conversion is applied twice  -  once display-side, once server-side

Test by:

Adding an item in one currency
Switching currency in the cart
Completing checkout
Checking what was actually charged

Also look for currency mismatches in refund flows. If you buy in USD and request a refund that processes in a weaker currency, there may be a discrepancy.
Testing Payment Flows Systematically

    B --> C["Modify price to 0, 0.01, -1"]
    C --> D{"Backend recalculates?"}

    F --> G["Test discount stacking"]
    G --> H["Test currency switching mid-flow"]
    H --> I["Race condition on coupon/promo codes"]

Intercept every request during checkout. Map all fields. Test each independently. Don't just test the obvious price field  -  look for discountAmount, taxRate, shippingCost, conversionRate, creditApplied.
PoC Documentation
For any price manipulation bug, your report needs:

The exact request with the modified field
The response showing the accepted (wrong) price
Screenshot of the order confirmation showing the manipulated amount
The order in your account history confirming it completed

Don't just show the HTTP response  -  show the order was actually created at the wrong price.
Checklist

 Map every field sent in cart/checkout requests  -  price, qty, discount, tax, currency
 Test negative values on all numeric fields
 Test zero price, zero qty (what does free mean to the app?)
 Attempt discount code stacking (same code twice, multiple distinct codes)
 Change currency mid-flow and check conversion consistency
 Test large numbers on quantity fields (int overflow)
 Check if Race Conditions apply to coupon redemption
 Look for price in hidden form fields on server-rendered pages
