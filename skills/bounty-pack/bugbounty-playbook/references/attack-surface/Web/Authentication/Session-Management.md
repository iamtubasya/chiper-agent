Session Management
Session management is unsexy but consequential. A broken session system undermines everything else  -  even a perfect authentication flow means nothing if the session token is predictable, doesn't expire, or persists after logout.
Session Fixation
The attack: set a known session ID on the victim before they authenticate. After authentication, if the app doesn't rotate the session ID, you already have a valid authenticated session.
Classic HTTP flow:
# 1. Attacker obtains a pre-auth session token (just visit the site)
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
# Response: Set-Cookie: session=ATTACKER_KNOWN_VALUE
 
# 2. Attacker sends victim a link with that session baked in
target.com/login
 
# 3. If the app accepts session IDs from URL parameters and doesn't rotate on login...
# Attacker's known session is now authenticated
Test by:

Getting a session cookie before login
Logging in with a fresh account
Checking if the session cookie value changed  -  it must change post-authentication

Token Entropy
Weak tokens are rare on Rails/Django/Express apps using built-in session handling. They appear on custom-built auth systems, legacy PHP apps, and anything where a developer rolled their own.
# Collect a bunch of session tokens
# Look for patterns  -  timestamp-based, sequential, short length
 
# Check token length
echo -n "SESSION_TOKEN_VALUE" | wc -c
# Anything under 16 bytes (32 hex chars) is worth investigating
 
# Check if it decodes to something readable
echo "SESSION_TOKEN" | base64 -d 2>/dev/null
If tokens look like user_id + timestamp + weak_hmac, that's a finding. Compute the HMAC yourself if you can guess the key.
Concurrent Session Handling
Does the app allow unlimited concurrent sessions? Should it?

Log in from two different browsers simultaneously  -  both sessions active?
Does the app notify the user of a new login?
Does logging out of one session invalidate the other?

On apps where sessions should be exclusive (banking, healthcare), unlimited concurrent sessions is a valid medium finding. More importantly, if a user changes their password, do all other sessions get invalidated? Test:
1. Log in from Browser A  -  get session A
2. Log in from Browser B  -  get session B
3. From Browser A: change password
4. From Browser B: try to access a protected endpoint using session B
If step 4 works  -  existing sessions survive password changes. That's almost always a P3.
Logout Failures
Server-side invalidation  -  the most common failure. The app clears the cookie client-side but never invalidates the session token server-side. Capture the session token before logout, logout, then replay the token.
GET /api/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Cookie: session=OLD_SESSION_TOKEN_CAPTURED_BEFORE_LOGOUT
If you get a 200  -  server-side invalidation is broken.
JWT-specific issue  -  stateless JWTs can't be "invalidated" without a denylist. If the app uses JWTs and doesn't maintain a token denylist, logout is purely cosmetic. See Privilege Escalation for JWT manipulation.
Cookie Flags
Always check. Missing flags are informational but chain well with other bugs.





















FlagMissing MeansSecureToken sent over HTTP, interceptable on networkHttpOnlyToken accessible via document.cookie  -  enables XSS-to-session-hijackSameSite=Strict/LaxToken sent on cross-site requests  -  enables CSRF (if relevant)
# Good
Set-Cookie: session=TOKEN; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/
 
# Bad  -  missing everything
Set-Cookie: session=TOKEN
Session After Password Reset / Account Compromise
When a user resets their password, existing sessions should be invalidated. Test:

Login → get session S1
Trigger password reset (as if attacker did it)
Complete the reset
Try using session S1 to access resources

If S1 still works  -  session invalidation on password reset is missing.
Token Storage in Frontend
Check where the token is stored:

localStorage  -  survives tab close, accessible to JS, XSS = full session theft
sessionStorage  -  gone on tab close, still accessible to JS
HttpOnly cookie  -  not accessible to JS, XSS can't directly steal it (but can use it via CSRF)

Not a standalone finding, but context for XSS severity and session security posture.
