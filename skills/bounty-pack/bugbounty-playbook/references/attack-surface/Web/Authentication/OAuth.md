OAuth
OAuth is a gift to bug bounty hunters. The spec is complex, implementations vary wildly, and developers frequently misunderstand what they're supposed to be protecting. Every app with "Login with Google/GitHub/Facebook" is worth testing here.

redirect_uri Manipulation
This is the big one. If the redirect_uri isn't strictly validated, you can steal auth codes.
Open redirect chaining  -  if the app allows redirect_uri=target.com/callback and there's an open redirect at target.com/redirect, try:
redirect_uri=target.com/redirect://evil.com
Path traversal  -  if the app validates the domain but not the path:
# Registered: target.com/callback
# Try:
redirect_uri=target.com/callback/../../../attacker-controlled-path
redirect_uri=target.com/callback%2F..%2F..%2Fevil
Subdomain/path confusion:
redirect_uri=target.com.evil.com/callback
redirect_uri=target.com/callback://evil.com
redirect_uri=target.com/callback#evil.com
State Parameter  -  CSRF on OAuth
If there's no state parameter, or it's not validated on return, the entire OAuth flow is vulnerable to CSRF. You can force a victim to link your account to theirs.
PoC:

Start an OAuth flow, capture the authorization URL
Don't complete it  -  grab the URL up to the redirect
Send that URL to a victim (logged in to the target app)
If the app doesn't validate state, victim's account gets linked to your OAuth identity

Token Leakage via Referer
Same issue as Password Reset  -  if the redirect lands on a page with third-party scripts and the access token appears in the URL fragment or query string, it leaks.
target.com/callback  -  that code ends up in Referer headers.
PKCE Bypass
PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is supposed to prevent code interception. Common implementation bugs:

code_verifier accepted without code_challenge being checked
Server accepts any code_verifier value regardless of what was sent during authorization
PKCE entirely optional when it should be required

Test by starting a PKCE flow, intercepting the token exchange, and removing or altering the code_verifier:
POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Host: auth.target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 
grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTH_CODE&redirect_uri=target.com/callback
# No code_verifier  -  does the server reject this?
Scope Escalation
Request scopes beyond what the app normally requests. Sometimes the auth server approves anything the client asks for without checking against what was registered.
# Normal request
scope=read:profile email
 
# Try escalating
scope=read:profile email admin write:all repo
Also look for scope confusion  -  if the app uses offline_access to get a refresh token but the refresh token has broader permissions than intended.
Account Takeover via Unlinked Email
Classic chain: target app allows sign-up with email and also supports OAuth. You register victim@gmail.com with a password. Victim later logs in via "Login with Google" using the same email. If the app merges these accounts automatically without email verification  -  you have the victim's account.
Implicit Flow
If the app is using the implicit flow (token returned directly in the URL fragment, not via code exchange), that's worth noting. Tokens in URL fragments can leak via:

Browser history
Server logs if the fragment gets accidentally server-side
JavaScript on the page reading window.location.hash

OIDC id_token Attacks
OpenID Connect layers identity on top of OAuth. The id_token is a JWT, which means every JWT attack applies  -  and then there are OIDC-specific issues on top.
Algorithm confusion on id_token  -  the same RS256-to-HS256 confusion that applies to auth JWTs applies here. If the IdP publishes its public key at /.well-known/jwks.json, try signing a forged id_token with HS256 using that public key. See JWT Attacks for the full technique.
Missing aud validation  -  the aud claim in an id_token should be the client's client_id. If the SP doesn't validate aud, you can replay an id_token issued for a different client application:
# Get an id_token from a different OAuth client on the same IdP
# Replay it to the target SP  -  does it accept?
POST /oauth/callback
id_token=TOKEN_ISSUED_FOR_OTHER_CLIENT
Missing iss validation  -  if the SP doesn't check the iss (issuer) claim, you can set up your own IdP, issue a token with the victim's sub, and replay it.
Nonce replay  -  the nonce in an id_token binds the token to a specific auth session. SPs that don't validate the nonce against the one they sent in the original authorization request are vulnerable to replay attacks with captured id_tokens.
Dynamic Client Registration Abuse
RFC 7591 defines a Dynamic Client Registration endpoint that lets clients register themselves programmatically. If the endpoint is unauthenticated or weakly authenticated:
POST /oauth/register HTTP/1.1
Host: auth.target.com
Content-Type: application/json
 
{
  "client_name": "Legit App",
  "redirect_uris": ["attacker.com/callback"],
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
  "response_types": ["code"]
}
A successful registration returns a client_id and optionally client_secret. You now have a registered OAuth client you control. Combined with a phishing or CSRF attack on a victim, you can harvest authorization codes that redirect to your callback.
Check for: /oauth/register, /connect/register, /.well-known/openid-configuration (look for registration_endpoint).
PKCE Downgrade
When a server supports PKCE but doesn't require it, a downgrade attack removes PKCE from the flow entirely. The existing PKCE bypass section covers implementation bugs; this is about the server accepting a code-exchange request with no code_verifier at all when the original authorization request included a code_challenge.
Test by starting a PKCE-enabled flow, capturing the auth code, then exchanging without the verifier:
POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Host: auth.target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 
grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTH_CODE&redirect_uri=target.com/callback
# code_verifier deliberately absent
If the server returns a token, PKCE is optional  -  meaning any intercepted code can be exchanged.
Cross-Device and CIBA Flows
Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628)  -  the device flow shows a user a code and a URL, then polls until they authenticate. If an attacker can send a victim a device-flow URL, the victim authenticates on their own device and the attacker receives the token on theirs. This is a social-engineering-assisted OAuth attack, but the technical enabler is the flow itself.
Look for: grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code in token requests; device_authorization_endpoint in OpenID config.
CIBA (Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication)  -  the client sends a login hint (email, phone number) and an out-of-band push notification goes to the user's device. If the login_hint parameter accepts attacker-supplied user identifiers without rate limiting, this enables account enumeration and potential push-notification spam. More critically  -  if the server doesn't properly bind the notification to the requesting session, there's a race condition where a spoofed client can request auth on behalf of a victim.
Cookie-Bound and DPoP Tokens
DPoP (Demonstrating Proof of Possession) binds access tokens to a specific key pair, making stolen tokens useless without the private key. It's a 2024-2025 adoption and shows up in newer OAuth implementations.
How to spot it: requests include a DPoP header containing a signed JWT alongside the Authorization: DPoP <token> header.
Where to look for bypasses:

Does the server validate the DPoP proof on every request, or only on token issuance?
Is the htm (HTTP method) and htu (HTTP URL) in the DPoP proof validated against the actual request?
Does the server accept Authorization: Bearer <token> when DPoP was negotiated?

# Test: send the access token as a Bearer token instead of DPoP-bound
GET /api/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: api.target.com
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
# No DPoP header  -  does the server accept it?
Cookie-bound tokens  -  some implementations bind tokens to a __Host- or __Secure- cookie. Check whether the token is also accepted via Authorization header, which strips the cookie binding.
Checklist

 Check the redirect_uri for open redirect chains, path traversal, and subdomain confusion
 Confirm state parameter is present and validated server-side on return
 Test whether state is tied to the session or just a static value
 Check for auth code leakage via Referer header on the callback page
 Start a PKCE flow, exchange the code without code_verifier  -  is it accepted?
 Test scope escalation by adding admin/write scopes to the authorization request
 Attempt the unlinked email account takeover (register by email, then OAuth with same email)
 Check for implicit flow tokens in URL fragments leaking to third-party scripts
 If OIDC: test aud and iss validation on id_tokens; check nonce replay
 Look for a Dynamic Client Registration endpoint and test unauthenticated access
 If DPoP is used: test Bearer token fallback and missing claim validation
 Check for a CIBA or Device Authorization endpoint and test login_hint enumeration
