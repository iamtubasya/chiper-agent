SSO & SAML
SAML is enterprise-grade authentication that's enterprise-grade broken. Every large target using "Login with your company account" is running SAML underneath. These bugs are high severity  -  SAML assertions represent trusted identity claims, so breaking validation is almost always a P1.
How SAML Works (Quick)
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant SP as SP
    participant IdP as IdP

    U->>SP: Access resource
    SP->>U: Redirect with SAMLRequest
    U->>IdP: Authenticate
    IdP->>U: Signed SAMLResponse
    U->>SP: POST /saml/acs
    Note over SP: Sig validation
    Note over SP: Replay check
    SP->>U: Session established

The SAMLResponse is a base64-encoded, signed XML document. The attack surface is entirely in how the SP validates that document.
Response Manipulation
Try the simplest thing first  -  decode the SAMLResponse, edit the <NameID> or email attribute to a victim/admin, re-encode, and replay. Some SPs skip signature validation entirely. I've seen this on production enterprise apps.
# Decode
echo "BASE64_SAML_RESPONSE" | base64 -d > response.xml
 
# Edit the NameID or email attribute
# <NameID>attacker@company.com</NameID>  →  <NameID>admin@company.com</NameID>
 
# Re-encode
base64 -w 0 response.xml
Submit the modified response in the SAMLResponse POST parameter. If no error, you're in.
XML Signature Wrapping (XSW)
The signature in SAML covers a specific XML element identified by an ID. XSW attacks insert a malicious unsigned element that shadows the signed one, exploiting ambiguity in how the SP processes the document.
The idea: the SP validates the signature on element with ID="signed"  -  that element is fine. But when the SP extracts the NameID, it picks up your unsigned injected element instead.
There are 8 classic XSW variants. Use the SAML Raider Burp extension  -  it automates all 8 and shows you which ones the SP accepts.
Manual example (XSW #2):
<samlp:Response>
  <!-- Injected malicious assertion (unsigned) -->
  <saml:Assertion ID="evil">
    <saml:NameID>admin@victim.com</saml:NameID>
  </saml:Assertion>
  <!-- Original signed assertion (valid signature) -->
  <saml:Assertion ID="original">
    <saml:NameID>attacker@attacker.com</saml:NameID>
    <ds:Signature>...valid signature over ID=original...</ds:Signature>
  </saml:Assertion>
</samlp:Response>
Assertion Replay
SAML assertions have a NotOnOrAfter expiry but many SPs don't track which assertions they've already consumed. Capture a valid assertion, store it, replay it hours/days later.
POST /saml/acs HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 
SAMLResponse=BASE64_CAPTURED_ASSERTION&RelayState=...
A properly implemented SP maintains an assertion ID cache and rejects duplicates. Test by replaying your own fresh assertion twice in a row  -  the second should fail with an error about reused assertions.
Signature Bypass via Algorithm Confusion
Remove the signature entirely  -  some SPs validate the signature only if it's present. If it's absent, they skip validation.
<!-- Remove the entire <ds:Signature> block and see what happens -->
Change the algorithm to none  -  modify <ds:SignatureMethod Algorithm="www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"/> to a null/none algorithm. Rare but has appeared in custom SAML parsers.
Comment injection  -  XML comments can sometimes confuse parsers:
<saml:NameID>admin<!---->.attacker@company.com</saml:NameID>
Burp + SAML Raider Workflow

Install SAML Raider from the BApp Store
Capture a SAMLResponse in Burp Proxy
Right-click → Extensions → SAML Raider → Send to SAML Raider
Run all XSW payloads automatically
For manual testing  -  decode, edit, re-encode in the SAML Raider panel directly

Common Misconfigurations

SP accepts assertions from any IdP (no issuer validation)  -  you can set up your own IdP and forge assertions
InResponseTo attribute not validated  -  enables CSRF-style attacks
ACS URL not validated  -  assertions can be posted to the wrong endpoint

SAML Signature Wrapping  -  XSW Classes
The XSW variants are numbered 1 through 8 based on where the malicious element is inserted relative to the signed element and the Response wrapper. SAML Raider tests all of them automatically, but understanding the structure helps you read the results and write your own variants.
The core principle across all XSW variants: the signature validator finds and validates the signed element by ID, but the application's NameID/attribute extractor picks up a different element. The two components disagree on which element "won".

To identify which SPs are vulnerable: use SAML Raider, run all 8 variants, and note which ones return a session rather than an error. If any succeed  -  the SP is extracting attributes from the unsigned element.
Vulnerable SP pattern to look for: custom SAML parsers that call getElementsByTagName("NameID")[0] rather than finding the element by the ID referenced in the <ds:Reference URI="#id"> of the signature.
Assertion Encryption Bypass
When an IdP is configured to send encrypted assertions (<saml:EncryptedAssertion>), the SP should reject unencrypted ones. Many don't.
Test: decode a SAMLResponse, strip the <saml:EncryptedAssertion> wrapper, insert a plain <saml:Assertion> with the attacker's NameID, and submit. If the SP accepts the plaintext assertion, it never enforced encryption at all.
<!-- Replace this -->
<saml:EncryptedAssertion>
  <xenc:EncryptedData>...</xenc:EncryptedData>
</saml:EncryptedAssertion>
 
<!-- With a plain unsigned assertion -->
<saml:Assertion ID="evil" ...>
  <saml:NameID>admin@target.com</saml:NameID>
  ...
</saml:Assertion>
This is particularly common when the SP was originally deployed without encryption and encryption was added to the IdP configuration later without updating the SP's validation requirements.
IdP-Initiated Flow Attacks
In SP-initiated SSO, the SP generates a SAMLRequest with an InResponseTo ID that the IdP must include in its response. The SP then verifies the response matches a request it sent.
In IdP-initiated SSO, there's no SAMLRequest  -  the IdP sends an assertion unprompted and the SP accepts it. The SP cannot validate InResponseTo (there is none). This opens several attack paths:

Forged assertion delivery  -  if you can set up or compromise an IdP that the SP trusts (or if the SP trusts all issuers), you can send assertions for any NameID
Missing RelayState validation  -  RelayState in IdP-initiated flows is attacker-controllable if the SP doesn't bind it to an authenticated session; this can redirect victims after login
Consent bypass  -  some apps show a consent screen during SP-initiated flow but skip it for IdP-initiated, allowing attribute disclosure without user awareness

Check whether the SP's ACS endpoint accepts assertions without a matching InResponseTo. Send a fresh assertion with no corresponding request:
POST /saml/acs HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 
SAMLResponse=BASE64_OF_ASSERTION_WITHOUT_IN_RESPONSE_TO
JIT Provisioning Role Abuse
Just-In-Time provisioning creates user accounts on first SSO login using attributes from the SAML assertion. If the IdP is one you control (or can manipulate), and the SP maps SAML attributes to roles or permissions without additional authorisation checks:
<!-- Assertion with attacker-controlled attribute values -->
<saml:AttributeStatement>
  <saml:Attribute Name="role">
    <saml:AttributeValue>admin</saml:AttributeValue>
  </saml:Attribute>
  <saml:Attribute Name="groups">
    <saml:AttributeValue>platform-admins</saml:AttributeValue>
  </saml:Attribute>
</saml:AttributeStatement>
If the SP provisions the account with role=admin purely because the assertion says so  -  that's a privilege escalation via attribute injection. This is common in B2B SaaS products that let enterprise customers bring their own IdP.
Testing approach: complete a normal SSO login, intercept the SAMLResponse, modify the role/group attribute values, and re-submit. Also test with a self-signed IdP if the SP has a "bring your own IdP" configuration option.
Checklist

 Decode the SAMLResponse and inspect the NameID, attributes, and signature structure
 Try modifying the NameID with no other changes  -  does the SP reject unsigned modifications?
 Run all 8 XSW variants using SAML Raider  -  note which ones produce a session
 Remove the entire <ds:Signature> block  -  does the SP accept a signature-free assertion?
 Try sending an unencrypted assertion when the IdP normally sends encrypted ones
 Test assertion replay  -  submit the same SAMLResponse twice in quick succession
 Submit an assertion without a corresponding InResponseTo  -  does the SP accept IdP-initiated flow?
 Check InResponseTo and NotBefore/NotOnOrAfter validation
 If JIT provisioning is enabled: inject role/group attribute values and check what's provisioned
 Check whether the ACS URL is validated against the registered SP metadata
 Test RelayState for open redirect if the SP performs a redirect post-login
 Check issuer (<saml:Issuer>) validation  -  does the SP accept assertions from any IdP?
