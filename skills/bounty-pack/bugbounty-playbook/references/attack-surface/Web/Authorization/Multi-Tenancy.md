Multi-Tenancy
Cross-tenant data access is consistently high severity  -  P1 on most programs  -  because it's not just your data at risk, it's every customer's data. SaaS platforms, B2B apps, and anything with "workspaces" or "organizations" is the target.
The Core Problem
Multi-tenant apps have to isolate data between tenants. That isolation usually happens at the application layer  -  a query filter like WHERE tenant_id = :current_tenant. When that filter is missing, misapplied, or bypassable, you get cross-tenant access.

    subgraph Tenant A
        UA[User A]
        DA[(Data A)]
    end
    subgraph Tenant B
        UB[User B]
        DB[(Data B)]
    end
    subgraph App Layer
        API[API Server]
        Q{tenant_id filter?}
    end

Tenant ID Manipulation
The most direct attack  -  find where the tenant ID is represented in the request and tamper with it.
URL-based tenant:
# Your tenant
GET /api/v1/tenants/acme-corp/users HTTP/1.1
 
# Competitor's tenant  -  do you get their users?
GET /api/v1/tenants/victim-corp/users HTTP/1.1
Header-based tenant:
GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
X-Tenant-ID: acme-corp
# Change to:
X-Tenant-ID: victim-corp
Subdomain-based tenant:
acme.target.com/api/users
Subdomain tenants are harder to attack directly, but look for places where the tenant identifier leaks into requests as a parameter elsewhere  -  admin APIs, export endpoints, support tools.
Testing with One Account
You only have one legitimate account. Here's how to still find cross-tenant issues:
Method 1  -  ID enumeration. Your tenant's objects have IDs. Try adjacent IDs. A resource at /api/documents/5001 belonging to your tenant  -  does /api/documents/4999 belong to another tenant and is it accessible?
Method 2  -  Tenant ID guessing. Tenant identifiers are often predictable (company name, domain, sequential integer). If you know the target company has a customer named "Acme Corp", try acme, acme-corp, acme_corp as the tenant ID.
Method 3  -  Shared resource endpoints. Look for endpoints that aggregate data across tenants for "benchmarking" or "analytics" features. These are often under-secured because they're not the main product.
Method 4  -  Invite/collaboration flows. If you can invite a user from Tenant B to collaborate on a resource in Tenant A, what happens to that shared resource's visibility? Does Tenant B now get access to Tenant A's broader data?
API Parameter Injection
When the tenant ID is embedded in the request body, try injecting additional parameters to access other tenant data:
POST /api/v1/search HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
 
{
  "query": "invoice",
  "tenant_id": "acme-corp"
}
 
# Try:
{
  "query": "invoice",
  "tenant_id": "acme-corp",
  "include_tenants": ["victim-corp"]
}
 
# Or just change tenant_id:
{
  "query": "invoice",
  "tenant_id": "victim-corp"
}
Shared Infrastructure Leakage
These aren't direct tenant ID attacks  -  they're bugs in shared components:
Shared caches  -  if tenant A warms a cache entry for a resource and tenant B can hit the same cache key (because the cache key doesn't include the tenant ID), B reads A's cached data. Look for cache-control headers, Varnish/Redis indicators, and test by querying the same resource from two tenants in quick succession.
Background jobs  -  export jobs, report generation, notification processing. These often process data from a job queue without tenant context. If you can inject your tenant ID into another tenant's job queue entry, the output might include cross-tenant data.
File storage  -  uploaded files stored at predictable paths without tenant scoping:
/uploads/invoices/2024-01-15-invoice.pdf  (no tenant in path)
vs.
/uploads/acme-corp/invoices/2024-01-15-invoice.pdf  (properly scoped)
Elevation of Impact
Cross-tenant access is already high severity. Elevation points:

Can you write to another tenant's data, not just read? (P1 almost anywhere)
Can you delete another tenant's resources? (P1)
Can you access admin/configuration data for another tenant? (P1)
Does the target process PII, PCI, or PHI? (regulatory implications = higher bounty)

Checklist

 Find all places tenant ID appears in requests (URL, header, body, cookie)
 Tamper with each  -  substitute competitor/test tenant IDs
 Enumerate adjacent object IDs from your tenant in cross-tenant context
 Test invite/collaboration flows for tenant boundary violations
 Check export/report endpoints  -  often aggregate across tenant boundaries
 Test file upload paths for predictable, non-scoped storage locations
 Check background job parameters for tenant context
