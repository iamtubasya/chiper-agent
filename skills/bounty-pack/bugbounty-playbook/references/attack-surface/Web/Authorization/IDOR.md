IDOR Patterns
IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) is the most consistently rewarded bug class in bug bounty. Programs pay for it reliably, it's everywhere, and finding it is mostly a matter of systematically testing every endpoint that accepts an ID. If you're going to master one thing, make it this.
The Core Idea
The app exposes an identifier in a request. The app uses that identifier to fetch/modify a resource. The app doesn't verify that the requesting user owns that resource. That's it.
GET /api/v1/invoices/1847 HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Cookie: session=YOUR_ACCOUNT_SESSION
 
# Change 1847 to 1846  -  does it return another user's invoice?
Where to Find Them
Every API endpoint that takes an ID. That's not an exaggeration. Build a list of every parameter in the app that looks like an identifier:

URL path segments: /users/123, /orders/abc-def, /files/upload_id
Query parameters: ?user_id=123, ?document=4592, ?account=B77F
Request body: {"recipient_id": 445, "message": "hello"}
Response bodies  -  IDs in responses that aren't in the request (and that you can then use in subsequent requests)

Use Burp's Logger++ or just HTTP History with the filter set to show only authenticated requests. Go through every unique endpoint.
UUID vs Sequential IDs
Sequential integers (/orders/1001, /orders/1002) are trivially enumerable. UUIDs feel "secure" but aren't a security control  -  they're just obscure. If you can find a UUID through another vector (leaky API response, another user's shared content, email headers), UUIDs are equally vulnerable.
UUIDs in one endpoint often appear in another:
# Your profile response returns:
{"user_id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479", "name": "attacker"}
 
# Try that ID in other endpoints:
GET /api/admin/users/f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479 HTTP/1.1
GET /api/messages?sender_id=f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479 HTTP/1.1
Horizontal vs Vertical IDOR
Horizontal  -  access another user's data at the same privilege level. Your account reads another user's private documents.
Vertical  -  access data or functions above your privilege level. Regular user reads admin records. This is higher severity and often overlaps with Privilege Escalation.
Parameter Tampering Patterns
Don't just change the obvious ID in the URL. Look for IDs in:
# JSON body
POST /api/transfer HTTP/1.1
{"from_account": 1001, "to_account": 1002, "amount": 100}
# Try changing from_account to another user's account
 
# Form data
POST /profile/update HTTP/1.1
user_id=123&email=newemail@attacker.com
# Change user_id to victim
 
# Hidden fields  -  check the HTML source
<input type="hidden" name="owner_id" value="456">
 
# Multipart upload
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="folder_id"

Encoded/Hashed IDs
Don't give up when you see what looks like a hash or opaque ID. Common patterns:
# Base64
echo "eyJ1c2VySWQiOiAiMTIzIn0=" | base64 -d
# {"userId": "123"}   -  just change 123
 
# URL-safe base64
echo "eyJ1c2VySWQiOiAiMTIzIn0" | base64 -d -  # add == padding
 
# Check if it's a JWT (three base64 parts separated by dots)
# See [[Privilege Escalation]]
 
# MD5/SHA1 of known values
echo -n "123" | md5sum
# If the ID in the app matches, increment the input and compute the next hash
Two-Account Testing Workflow
This is the methodology  -  don't skip it:
Account A (attacker): create resources, generate IDs, note them
Account B (victim): log in, note your own resource IDs
 
From Account A's session:
→ Try accessing Account B's resource IDs
→ Try modifying Account B's resources
→ Try deleting Account B's resources
 
From Account B's session:
→ Confirm that those resources belong to B and are accessible to B
Always confirm the object exists and belongs to the other user before claiming IDOR  -  false positives waste everyone's time.
