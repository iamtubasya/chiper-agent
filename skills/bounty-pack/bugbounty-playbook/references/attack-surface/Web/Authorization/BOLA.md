BOLA & BFLA
BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) and BFLA (Broken Function Level Authorization) are the OWASP API Security Top 10 names for what used to be called IDOR and vertical privilege escalation. The framing matters because API-first apps expose these differently than traditional web apps.
BOLA vs Classic IDOR
They're the same bug. BOLA is the API-centric framing  -  OWASP introduced it because REST APIs make the pattern more visible. In an API, every resource is an object accessed via its ID. When authorization isn't checked at the object level, you get BOLA.
Classic IDOR:   GET /invoices/1234  (web page)
BOLA:           GET /api/v2/invoices/1234  (API endpoint)
The reason BOLA gets its own name: API endpoints are more systematically enumerable. You find them in JS bundles, Swagger/OpenAPI specs, mobile app traffic, and Postman collections leaked on GitHub.
BFLA  -  Function Level Authorization
Where BOLA is about which data you can access, BFLA is about what you can do. Regular users accessing admin functions.
# BOLA  -  accessing another user's object
GET /api/v1/users/456/profile HTTP/1.1
 
# BFLA  -  accessing an admin function as a regular user
DELETE /api/v1/users/456 HTTP/1.1
POST /api/v1/admin/impersonate HTTP/1.1
GET /api/v1/users?export=all HTTP/1.1
BFLA is usually higher severity  -  it's not just data leakage, it's unauthorized capability execution.
Finding API Endpoints
You can't test what you can't find. Enumerate aggressively.
Swagger/OpenAPI specs  -  check common paths:
/swagger.json
/openapi.json
/api/swagger.json
/api-docs
/v1/api-docs
/v2/api-docs
/swagger-ui.html
/.well-known/openapi
JavaScript bundle analysis  -  download the main JS bundle, search for API patterns:
curl target.com/static/js/main.chunk.js | grep -oP '"/api/[^"]*"' | sort -u
Mobile traffic  -  proxy Android/iOS traffic through Burp. Mobile apps often hit undocumented API endpoints not exposed in the web app.

BOLA Testing Pattern
flowchart TD
    A[Find API endpoint with object ID] --> B[Note your own object IDs - Account A]
    B --> C[Note victim object IDs - Account B]
    C --> D{Test from Account A}
    D --> E[GET victim object  -  data leak?]
    D --> F[PUT/PATCH victim object  -  data modification?]
    D --> G[DELETE victim object  -  destructive IDOR?]
    E --> H{Response contains victim data?}
    H -->|Yes| I[BOLA confirmed - document it]
    H -->|No| J[Check indirect references in response]

API Versioning  -  Check All Versions
New API versions often have authorization fixes. Old ones often don't. If v2 is locked down, try v1, v0, beta, internal:
GET /api/v2/users/456  → 403 Forbidden
GET /api/v1/users/456  → 200 OK (BOLA on deprecated endpoint)
GET /api/internal/users/456  → 200 OK
HTTP Method Switching
An endpoint might have authorization on GET but not on PUT. Or DELETE might be completely unprotected:
GET /api/v1/reports/789    → 403 (auth checked)
DELETE /api/v1/reports/789 → 200 (no auth check)
HEAD /api/v1/reports/789   → 200 (leaks existence)
Try all methods  -  GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS  -  on every endpoint you find.
Mass Assignment  -  BOLA's Cousin
When updating an object via API, include fields that shouldn't be user-controllable:
PATCH /api/v1/users/me HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
 
{
  "name": "Attacker",
  "email": "attacker@attacker.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "is_verified": true,
  "subscription_tier": "enterprise"
}
If the API passes the entire body to the ORM without field filtering (common in Rails, Django REST Framework, Mongoose), those extra fields get updated. This is mass assignment  -  related to BFLA when the affected fields relate to authorization.
Checklist

 Found all API endpoints (Swagger, JS bundles, mobile traffic)
 Tested all API versions (v1, v2, internal, beta)
 Tested all HTTP methods on each endpoint
 Tested BOLA with two accounts (object-level)
 Tested BFLA  -  admin functions accessible to regular users
 Tested mass assignment on PUT/PATCH endpoints
