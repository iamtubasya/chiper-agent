Access Control
Access control bugs in smart contracts are often trivially visible in the source code and catastrophically exploitable on-chain. Missing a single onlyOwner modifier on a mint() function means anyone can print unlimited tokens. An uninitialised proxy implementation means anyone can become owner. These aren't subtle logic errors  -  they're missing guards on dangerous functions.
Missing Role Modifiers
The simplest variant: a privileged function with no access control at all.
// VULNERABLE: anyone can mint
contract Token {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
 
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        // No modifier. Anyone calls this.
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
 
// CORRECT
contract Token {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    address public owner;
 
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "not owner");
        _;
    }
 
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
When auditing, search every external and public function for missing modifiers. Focus on: mint, burn, setFee, setOwner, transferOwnership, pause, unpause, upgrade, setOracle, withdrawFees.

Uninitialised Proxy Implementation
Covered in Smart Contract Basics, but the access control angle deserves its own treatment. When an upgradeable contract is deployed:

The proxy is deployed and initialize() is called  -  this sets the owner on the proxy's storage
The implementation contract is deployed separately but initialize() is NOT called on it  -  its storage is empty

If you find an implementation contract where initialized == false, you can call initialize() with your own address, become owner, then call the upgrade function to point the proxy at a malicious implementation.
# Check if an implementation contract is uninitialised
# Read the initialized flag (usually slot 0 for OZ Initializable)
cast storage 0xIMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS 0x0 --rpc-url $RPC
 
# If returns 0x00...00, it's uninitialised
# Call initialize with your address
cast send 0xIMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS "initialize(address)" YOUR_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC --private-key $KEY
Real-world instance: The Wormhole team deployed an unguarded implementation contract. A researcher found it and called initialize(), setting themselves as guardian. They responsibly disclosed rather than exploiting. The bug was fixed and the researcher was paid a large bounty.
delegatecall Context Confusion
delegatecall runs the callee's code in the caller's context: the caller's storage, the caller's address(this), and the caller's ETH balance are all used. The callee's storage is untouched.
// VULNERABLE: proxy calls attacker-controlled address via delegatecall
contract Proxy {
    address public implementation;
    address public owner;  // slot 1
 
    function (bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes memory) {
        (bool ok, bytes memory result) = implementation.delegatecall(data);
        require(ok);
        return result;
    }
}
 
// Attacker deploys a contract with:
contract Exploit {
    address public slot0;  // aligns with Proxy.implementation (slot 0)
    address public owner;  // aligns with Proxy.owner (slot 1)
 
    function pwn(address newOwner) external {
        // When called via delegatecall, this writes to Proxy.owner
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
Storage slot alignment is the source of countless proxy bugs. If the implementation contract's variable layout doesn't match the proxy's expected layout, a delegatecall can overwrite unexpected storage slots. An attacker who can control which implementation is called can overwrite the owner or implementation slot directly.
Self-Destruct in Proxy Implementations
If a proxy's implementation contract contains a selfdestruct that an attacker can call:
// Parity Multisig implementation contract had this
function kill() external onlyOwner {
    selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));
}
When the implementation is selfdestructed, the bytecode at that address becomes empty. Every proxy pointing at it then delegates to empty bytecode and returns no data. All proxies that depended on that implementation become permanently broken.
Parity Multisig (2017)  -  $150M+ frozen. A user accidentally called initWallet() on the uninitialised implementation contract, became its owner, then called kill(). The implementation selfdestructed. Every Parity multisig wallet that used it became an empty proxy forwarding to destroyed code. The funds are frozen permanently.
tx.origin vs msg.sender
tx.origin is the original EOA that started the transaction. msg.sender is the immediate caller. If a protocol uses tx.origin for authorisation, any contract the authorised EOA calls can perform authorised actions on their behalf.
// VULNERABLE: tx.origin check is bypassable
contract Vault {
    address public owner;
 
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        require(tx.origin == owner, "not owner");  // wrong
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
 
// Attack: deploy a contract, trick the owner into calling it
// The owner's transaction has tx.origin == owner
// The attacker contract calls Vault.withdraw()
// tx.origin still equals owner  -  auth passes
// msg.sender is the attacker contract  -  gets the funds
flowchart LR
    A["Owner's EOA<br/>(tx.origin = owner)"] --> B["Attacker Contract<br/>(msg.sender for Vault)"]
    B --> C["Vault.withdraw()<br/>tx.origin check passes"]
    C --> D["ETH sent to<br/>attacker contract"]

tx.origin should never be used for authorisation. Its only safe use is distinguishing EOA calls from contract calls (for anti-bot measures), and even that is fragile.
OpenZeppelin AccessControl vs Ownable
Two standard patterns for managing roles:
Ownable: Single owner address, transferOwnership() to change it. Simple but only supports one role.
AccessControl: Role-based system with grantRole, revokeRole, renounceRole. Each role is a bytes32 identifier. DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can manage all other roles by default  -  check who holds it.
// AccessControl audit targets:
// 1. Who holds DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE?
// 2. Can any role grant itself additional roles?
// 3. Are role assignments done in the constructor or a separate initializer?
// 4. Can a role be granted to address(0)?
 
bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");
 
// Check if DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is held by a multisig or an EOA
// An EOA holding admin is a centralisation risk (and often in scope as High)
Audius Governance Takeover (2022)
Audius suffered a governance attack where an attacker exploited an initialisation bug in their governance contract. The attacker found that the governance contract could be re-initialised, which reset the proposal threshold to 0. They then created a proposal to transfer 18M AUDIO tokens to themselves and executed it in the same transaction. Loss: approximately $6M.
The root cause was a missing initialisation guard  -  initialize() could be called more than once because the contract used a custom initialisation pattern that didn't use OpenZeppelin's Initializable properly.
Checklist

 List all external and public functions; verify each has appropriate access control
 Check proxy implementations for uninitialised state (call initialize() on the implementation address)
 Audit storage layout alignment between proxy and all implementation versions
 Search for selfdestruct in implementation contracts and verify the caller restriction
 Search for tx.origin usage; any use for authorisation is a finding
 Identify who holds DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE and whether it's an EOA or multisig
 Check initialize() functions for re-initialisation guards
 Verify transferOwnership emits events and uses a two-step process if high value
 Look for functions that can change the implementation address without timelock
