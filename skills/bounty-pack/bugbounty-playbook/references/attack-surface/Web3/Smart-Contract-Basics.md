Smart Contract Basics
Smart contracts are programs that live on a blockchain, execute deterministically, and can't be modified once deployed  -  unless they're designed to be upgradeable, which introduces its own class of bugs. This page is orientation for a web security researcher, not a Solidity tutorial.
The EVM and Solidity at a Glance
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a stack-based virtual machine. Every contract has an address, bytecode, and persistent storage. Solidity compiles down to EVM bytecode. Transactions call functions by sending calldata to a contract address. The chain executes the bytecode and updates state.
A minimal ERC-20-style contract:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
 
contract SimpleToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    address public owner;
 
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
 
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "not owner");
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
 
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "insufficient");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
Key globals you'll see everywhere:

msg.sender  -  the address that called the current function (could be another contract)
msg.value  -  ETH sent with the call, in wei
tx.origin  -  the original EOA (externally owned account) that initiated the transaction chain; differs from msg.sender if called via contract
block.timestamp  -  current block time in seconds; manipulable by miners within ~15 seconds

ABI and Function Selectors
The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is the schema for how to call a contract. It describes function names, parameter types, and return types. When you call a function, the first 4 bytes of calldata are the function selector  -  the first 4 bytes of keccak256("functionName(paramType1,paramType2)").
# Compute a function selector with cast
cast sig "transfer(address,uint256)"
# 0xa9059cbb
 
# Decode calldata
cast calldata-decode "transfer(address,uint256)" 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000d8da6bf...
 
# Read a public state variable (storage slot 0 here)
cast storage 0xCONTRACT_ADDRESS 0 --rpc-url mainnet.infura.io/v3/KEY
Why selectors matter for bugs: two different function signatures can produce the same 4-byte selector (a collision). Rare but exploitable when a contract uses abi.encodeWithSelector without fully validating the target.
Storage Slots
Contract state variables occupy storage slots numbered from 0. Mappings and dynamic arrays use keccak256-derived slot positions.
contract Storage {
    uint256 public slot0;          // slot 0
    address public slot1;          // slot 1
    mapping(address => uint256) balances; // slot 2 base; actual data at keccak256(key . 2)
}
Storage is public on-chain regardless of Solidity visibility modifiers. private means other contracts can't call it; it does not mean the data is secret. You can read any slot with:
cast storage 0xCONTRACT_ADDRESS 0x2 --rpc-url $RPC
This matters for proxy patterns (see below) and for finding "hidden" privileged addresses or credentials stored on-chain.
Proxy Patterns
Upgradeable contracts split logic from storage using delegatecall. The proxy holds storage and forwards calls to an implementation contract. The implementation's code runs in the proxy's storage context.
Three patterns you'll encounter on every major protocol:
EIP-1967 (storage slots for implementation address):
The implementation address lives at a specific storage slot (0x360894...) to avoid collisions with the proxy's own variables. The admin address at 0xb53127....
# Read the implementation address of an EIP-1967 proxy
cast storage 0xPROXY_ADDRESS 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076d4264954935e7a1cd091c2 --rpc-url $RPC
Transparent Proxy (OpenZeppelin):
Admin calls go to the proxy itself (admin functions like upgrade). User calls are forwarded to the implementation. The admin and user must be different addresses  -  if the admin accidentally calls a user function, it hits the proxy, not the implementation, and silently does nothing.
UUPS (EIP-1822):
The upgrade logic lives inside the implementation contract itself. If the implementation doesn't include the upgrade function (e.g., a developer forgot it), the contract becomes permanently non-upgradeable. The upgrade function must be protected or anyone can swap the implementation.

The classic proxy bug: a deployed implementation contract that was never initialised. Because constructor() runs in the implementation's own context (not the proxy's), initialisation must happen via an initialize() function after deployment. If nobody called initialize() on the implementation, you can call it and set yourself as owner, then call upgradeTo() and point the proxy at a selfdestruct implementation.
Events and Off-Chain Indexing
Events are logged to the transaction receipt, not to contract storage. They're cheap to emit but can't be read by other on-chain contracts. Indexers (The Graph, Etherscan, Alchemy) use them to build queryable history.
Why they matter for bugs:

A contract that doesn't emit events on privileged actions makes on-chain monitoring harder  -  note this in audit findings but it's rarely bounty-eligible on its own
Off-chain systems that rely on events for critical state (e.g., a bridge relayer that watches Deposit events) can be manipulated if event emission is decoupled from state changes

Testnets, Mainnet, and Local Forks

# Fork mainnet at the latest block

# Fork at a specific block (for historical PoC reproduction)

# Run your Foundry test against the fork
forge test --fork-url mainnet.infura.io/v3/KEY -vvvv
Local forks give you the full mainnet state (all deployed contracts, all balances) in an environment you control. This is the correct place to develop and validate every web3 PoC.
Checklist

 Find the verified source on Etherscan or Sourcify before reading bytecode
 Identify whether the contract is a proxy; read the implementation address from EIP-1967 slots
 Check if the implementation contract was initialised after deployment
 Map all storage slots for sensitive variables (owner, admin, fee recipient)
 List all external/public functions and their access control modifiers
 Note all delegatecall usages and verify storage layout alignment
 Check the Solidity compiler version for pre-0.8 overflow risk
 Confirm tx.origin is not used for authorisation anywhere
 Identify all oracle calls and external contract dependencies
 Set up a local anvil fork before attempting any PoC
