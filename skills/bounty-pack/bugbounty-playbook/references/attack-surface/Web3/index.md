Web3 & Smart Contracts
Web3 bug bounty is code review with money on the line. There's no login to bypass, no intercepting traffic in Burp  -  the code is public, the state is public, and every transaction is permanent. A single vulnerability in a DeFi protocol can drain hundreds of millions of dollars in one block.
How Web3 Bug Bounty Differs from Web2
The mechanics are different enough to warrant their own mental model.
Public code is the whole game. Smart contracts are deployed on-chain; the bytecode (and usually the Solidity source via Etherscan verification) is publicly readable. You audit the code the same way a compiler does. There's no hidden server-side logic to discover through fuzzing headers.
Primacy of disclosure, not exploitation. On Immunefi, the dominant web3 platform, the rule is firm: you find it, you report it, you wait. Exploiting a live vulnerability to prove it  -  even returning the funds  -  usually voids the bounty and may constitute theft under the platform's rules. The whitehat escrow process exists for edge cases involving live funds at risk.
No-mainnet-exploitation rule. PoCs go in local fork environments (Foundry's anvil, Hardhat's network) or on testnets, not on mainnet. See Tooling for the forked-mainnet workflow.
Scope on Immunefi is tiered by impact. Critical findings (usually $500K+ protocols) can pay $50K to $10M+. Smart contract bugs are almost always the scope. Frontend bugs, admin key compromise, and social engineering are typically out of scope.

Immunefi Scope Conventions
Immunefi programs list assets by contract address and categorise bugs by severity:

Critical - direct theft of funds, permanent freezing of funds, minting unbounded tokens
High - temporary freezing, theft below a threshold, governance manipulation
Medium - griefing, temporary DoS, minor losses
Low - cosmetic issues, events not emitted, informational

Each program sets its own bounty table. Read the scope carefully before starting  -  many programs exclude specific contract versions, specific functions, or require a minimum loss threshold. See Immunefi for platform-specific guidance.
Pages in This Section

Smart Contract Basics  -  ABI, storage slots, proxy patterns, testnets. Start here if you're new to Solidity.
Reentrancy  -  classic, cross-function, read-only, and cross-contract variants. The DAO was 2016; protocols still get hit.
Oracle Manipulation  -  price oracles, flash-loan-weighted attacks, spot vs TWAP. Responsible for some of the largest DeFi losses.
Access Control  -  missing modifiers, uninitialised proxies, delegatecall confusion, tx.origin vs msg.sender.
Integer and Precision  -  overflow/underflow, rounding direction, decimal mismatches, share inflation attacks.
Signature and Replay  -  EIP-712, nonce management, cross-chain replay, permit frontrunning, ecrecover edge cases.
MEV and Frontrunning  -  what counts as a bounty finding vs ambient mempool reality, sandwich attacks, commit-reveal failures.
Cross-Chain Bridge  -  the largest loss category in web3 history. Signature bypass, Merkle proof bugs, validator compromise.
Tooling  -  Foundry, Slither, Echidna, Tenderly, Chisel. The standard toolkit for PoC development and static analysis.
