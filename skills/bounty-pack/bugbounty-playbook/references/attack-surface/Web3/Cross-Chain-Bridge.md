Cross-Chain Bridge
Bridges are where the largest single losses in web3 history happened. Ronin ($625M), Poly Network ($611M), Wormhole ($320M), Nomad ($190M), Harmony Horizon ($100M). The attack surface is broad because bridges sit at the intersection of multiple chains, multiple smart contracts, off-chain relayers, and threshold signature schemes  -  each component a potential point of failure.
Cumulative bridge losses exceed $2B. When Immunefi publishes its yearly loss reports, bridges dominate the top entries every year.
Bridge Models
Three main architectures, each with a distinct attack surface:
Lock-mint (wrapped asset):
User locks native tokens on Chain A. Validators observe the lock event. The bridge mints wrapped tokens on Chain B. To redeem, the wrapped tokens are burned on Chain B and the native tokens released on Chain A.
Attack surface: the verification that the lock happened on Chain A before minting on Chain B. If validators can be bypassed or fooled, you can mint without locking.
Mint-burn (canonical bridge):
Similar to lock-mint but the bridge protocol owns the minting rights. No separate "wrapped" representation; the bridge's contract on each chain issues the canonical token. Compromise of the bridge's signing authority means unlimited minting.
Liquidity pool (native swap):
User deposits on Chain A, the bridge's liquidity provider on Chain B releases tokens from a pool. No wrapping; both sides use native tokens. Attack surface: the accounting between chains, the LP's solvency guarantees, and the messaging layer that confirms deposits.

Signature Verification Attacks
The Wormhole exploit ($320M, February 2022) is the canonical signature verification bypass. Wormhole used Solana's native signature verification instruction (secp256k1_program) to validate guardian signatures. The bridge expected the verification to have been run; it checked that a verification instruction was present, but didn't verify the instruction referenced the correct data.
The attacker crafted a transaction with a secp256k1 instruction that verified a different, attacker-controlled message, then called the bridge's complete_wrapped function. The bridge saw the instruction present, treated it as valid, and minted 120,000 wETH.
The generalised lesson: verification of a process is not the same as verification of the result. If a contract checks that a function was called rather than checking the return value of that function, or checks that a proof was provided without validating what the proof covers, there is an attack.
When auditing signature verification in bridges:

Check that the hash being verified is the hash of the actual deposit message, not some attacker-supplied hash
Confirm that the verification result (true/false) is actually checked, not just that verification was attempted
Verify the signer set matches the expected validator set for the correct epoch

Merkle Proof Verification Bugs
The Nomad bridge exploit ($190M, August 2022) was caused by a Merkle root initialisation bug. During an upgrade, the contract's trusted root was set to bytes32(0)  -  all zeros. The Merkle proof verification function used require(acceptableRoot[messages])wheremessageswas the Merkle leaf. Becausebytes32(0)` was marked as trusted, any message with a zero root (which is what any empty/malformed proof produces) was accepted.
The result: the check was bypassed by submitting an empty proof. Anyone could call the bridge's process() function with any message  -  no valid proof required. The attack was copied by hundreds of opportunists in the same block.
// Simplified vulnerable pattern
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public acceptableRoot;
 
function process(bytes memory message, bytes32[32] calldata proof) external {
    bytes32 root = merkleRoot(proof, keccak256(message));
    // If acceptableRoot[bytes32(0)] == true, then any message with empty proof passes
    require(acceptableRoot[root], "invalid proof");
    _execute(message);
}
When auditing Merkle bridges:

Check all root initialisation paths, especially in upgrade/migration functions
Verify that bytes32(0) is never a trusted root
Trace the proof verification to confirm it validates the path from leaf to root against a specific committed root, not just any acceptable root

Validator and Committee Compromise
The Ronin bridge ($625M, March 2022) was not a code bug  -  it was a validator key compromise. The Ronin bridge used a threshold signature scheme where 5 of 9 validators had to sign. The attacker (attributed to Lazarus Group) compromised 4 validators via spear phishing, then exploited a backdoor in a separate Axie DAO validator node. With 5 valid signatures, they signed fraudulent withdrawal transactions.
For bounty hunters, full validator compromise is typically out of scope (it's an operational security issue, not a contract bug). What is in scope:

The threshold is set too low and an attacker could reach it by compromising public endpoints
Validator set changes can be triggered by a single compromised key
Emergency functions (pause, halt) require only 1-of-N signatures
Validator signatures are not bound to a specific epoch or nonce (allowing reuse)

Cross-Chain Replay
Covered in depth in Signature and Replay, but specific to bridges: a deposit proof from Chain A replayed on Chain A's other bridge endpoint, or a withdrawal message from an old bridge version replayed against an upgraded bridge.
The Harmony Horizon bridge ($100M, June 2022) used a 2-of-5 multisig. Two keys were compromised. The bridge also lacked sufficient replay protection  -  messages could be reused across bridge versions.

Checklist

 Identify the bridge architecture: lock-mint, mint-burn, or liquidity pool
 Trace the full path from deposit on Chain A to release on Chain B
 Audit the signature verification logic: is the hash covering the correct message?
 Check all Merkle root initialisation paths for zero-value or default-value roots
 Verify that bytes32(0) and similar sentinel values are never trusted roots
 Count the validator/guardian threshold and assess whether it can be reached via public key exposure
 Check all withdrawal and minting functions for replay protection (nonces, chain IDs)
 Look for upgrade functions that reset trusted roots, nonces, or validator sets
 Verify that the bridge contracts on both chains reject each other's proofs (cross-chain replay)
 Run Slither on both ends of the bridge contract pair
