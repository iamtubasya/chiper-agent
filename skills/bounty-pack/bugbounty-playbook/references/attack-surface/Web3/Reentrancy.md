Reentrancy
Reentrancy is the oldest consistently-paid bug class in smart contracts. The DAO in 2016 lost $60M to a classic reentrancy. In 2021, Cream Finance lost $18.8M to a cross-contract variant. In 2022, Fei Protocol paid $80M in losses to a cross-function variant. The pattern survives because developers add nonReentrant to their withdrawal functions and forget that reentrancy can enter through other paths.
Classic Reentrancy
The DAO attack pattern. A contract sends ETH before updating its state, the recipient's receive() or fallback() function calls back into the original contract before the state update completes.
// VULNERABLE: state update after external call
contract VulnerableBank {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
 
    function deposit() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
 
    function withdraw() external {
        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "nothing to withdraw");
 
        // External call BEFORE state update  -  reentrancy window here
        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success);
 
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;  // too late
    }
}
The attacker deploys a contract with a receive() function that calls withdraw() again. When call{value: amount} executes, balances[msg.sender] is still the original value, so the check passes again. The loop continues until the bank is drained.
contract Attacker {
    VulnerableBank bank;
    uint256 constant TIMES = 10;
    uint256 count;
 
    constructor(address _bank) { bank = VulnerableBank(_bank); }
 
    receive() external payable {
        if (count < TIMES) {
            count++;
            bank.withdraw();
        }
    }
 
    function attack() external payable {
        bank.deposit{value: msg.value}();
        bank.withdraw();
    }
}

Cross-Function Reentrancy
Classic reentrancy enters the same function twice. Cross-function reentrancy enters a different function that shares the same state. Adding nonReentrant only to withdraw() does not protect against re-entering transfer().
contract VulnerableToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
 
    // nonReentrant on withdraw  -  but not on transfer
    function withdraw() external nonReentrant {
        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        (bool ok,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(ok);
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;  // attacker reenters transfer() before this line
    }
 
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
The attacker's receive() calls transfer() during the withdraw() call. Their balance hasn't been zeroed yet, so they can transfer their full balance to a second address while also receiving the full ETH withdrawal.
Read-Only Reentrancy
The most subtle variant. A view function returns stale state while a transaction is mid-execution. Another contract reads that view function during the callback window and makes decisions based on incorrect data.
This matters in DeFi when a protocol reads a price or balance from another contract that's in the middle of a state change.
// Protocol A is being called during a Curve pool's remove_liquidity()
// Curve pool's totalSupply hasn't been updated yet, but ETH has been sent
// Protocol A reads Curve's get_virtual_price() which returns inflated price
// Protocol A mints too many tokens based on the inflated read
Slither's reentrancy-no-eth detector catches some variants, but read-only reentrancy requires manual analysis of cross-contract call sequences. The fix is either using nonReentrant on view functions (expensive) or ensuring external reads happen before any state changes.
Cross-Contract Reentrancy
Two contracts share state (often a shared storage contract or a registry). Contract A calls into the attacker mid-operation. The attacker calls Contract B, which reads the shared state that Contract A hasn't finished updating.
This pattern appears frequently in:

Vault contracts that share a price oracle
Lending protocols where collateral and debt live in separate contracts
Liquidity pools with callbacks (Uniswap V3 flash loans)

Checks-Effects-Interactions and Why It Fails
The Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern is the primary mitigation:

Checks  -  validate all conditions (require statements)
Effects  -  update all state variables
Interactions  -  make external calls last

// CEI-compliant
function withdraw() external {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];   // Check
    require(amount > 0);                      // Check
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;                 // Effect  -  state updated BEFORE call
    (bool ok,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");  // Interaction
    require(ok);
}
CEI fails in cross-function and read-only reentrancy because the "Interactions" step of one function can trigger the "Checks" step of a different function against stale state. CEI is necessary but not sufficient.
The nonReentrant Modifier
OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard uses a status flag in storage:
uint256 private _status;
 
modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(_status != _ENTERED, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    _status = _ENTERED;
    _;
    _status = _NOT_ENTERED;
}
Key limits:

Per-contract only. nonReentrant on contract A does not block reentry through contract B, even if B shares state with A.
Not transitive. A function without nonReentrant in the same contract is still enterable during a nonReentrant call.
Gas cost. Two storage writes per call. Solidity 0.8.x with immutable or transient storage (EIP-1153) reduces this.

Slither Detection
# Run all reentrancy detectors
slither . --detect reentrancy-eth,reentrancy-no-eth,reentrancy-benign,reentrancy-events
 
# Output: function name, path to vulnerable call, and the state variable at risk
# reentrancy-eth catches ETH-transferring reentrancy (highest severity)
# reentrancy-no-eth catches state reentrancy without ETH transfer
Slither misses read-only reentrancy and complex cross-contract flows. Use it as a first pass, then trace call graphs manually for DeFi protocols with callbacks.
Famous Cases
The DAO (2016)  -  $60M. Classic reentrancy in the splitDAO function. ETH sent before the balance was updated. Triggered the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic fork.
Cream Finance (2021)  -  $18.8M. Cross-contract reentrancy via a flash loan callback. The attacker used CREAM's own flash loan callback to re-enter a lending function before price state was updated.
Fei Protocol / Rari Fuse (2022)  -  $80M. Cross-function reentrancy in Compound fork code. The _repayBorrowFresh function called into the attacker's contract before updating the borrow balance, allowing repeated re-borrowing.
Checklist

 Trace every call(), transfer(), send(), and ERC-777/ERC-721 callback to its target
 Verify CEI order in every function that makes an external call or sends ETH
 Check that nonReentrant is on ALL functions sharing state, not just withdrawal functions
 Look for cross-function variants: can re-entering a different function exploit shared state?
 Check for ERC-777 tokensReceived hooks, ERC-721 onERC721Received, and ERC-1155 callbacks
 Identify any view functions that return values another contract might read during a callback
 Run Slither reentrancy detectors and review each finding
 Map all cross-contract calls where a callback could arrive before state is finalised
 Test flash loan callbacks as reentrancy entry points
 Write a Foundry PoC against a mainnet fork to confirm exploitability
