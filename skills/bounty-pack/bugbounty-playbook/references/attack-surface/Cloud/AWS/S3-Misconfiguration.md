S3 Misconfiguration
S3 buckets are still one of the most reliable ways to get a medium-high on a cloud program. Public listing is usually P3/medium, but write access or exposed PII bumps it to P2/high easily. Bucket policy misconfigs are the sneaky ones - the bucket isn't "public" in the classic sense but the policy grants s3:GetObject to * on specific prefixes.
Finding Buckets
Start with permutations of the company name, product names, and known subdomains:
# s3scanner - fast bulk checking
s3scanner scan --buckets-file wordlist.txt
 
# Manual permutations to try
company-name
company-name-assets
company-name-backup
company-name-dev
company-name-staging
company-name-prod
company-name-logs
company-name-data
assets.company.com (CNAME -> S3 sometimes)
Also check:

JS files for bucket names (hardcoded S3 URLs)
Network traffic in Burp while using the app (S3 presigned URLs reveal bucket names)
GitHub/GitLab for config files, terraform, CloudFormation templates

Testing Access
# Check if listing is enabled (unauthenticated)
aws s3 ls s3://BUCKET_NAME --no-sign-request
 
# List all objects if listing is on
aws s3 ls s3://BUCKET_NAME --recursive --no-sign-request
 
# Check read access on a specific object
aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET_NAME/somefile.txt /tmp/test --no-sign-request
 
# Check write access - always use a clearly-named bounty file
echo "bugbounty-test-$(date +%s)" > /tmp/bb_test.txt
aws s3 cp /tmp/bb_test.txt s3://BUCKET_NAME/bugbounty-test.txt --no-sign-request
# Clean up immediately after confirming
aws s3 rm s3://BUCKET_NAME/bugbounty-test.txt --no-sign-request
 
# Check ACL on bucket
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME --no-sign-request
Policy Abuse
Even when a bucket isn't fully public, the bucket policy might grant access under certain conditions. Check the policy if you have any authenticated access:
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket BUCKET_NAME
Watch for:

"Principal": "*" with any action - fully public
"Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::*:root"} - any AWS account
Conditions keyed on aws:Referer or aws:SourceIp - bypass with the right header/IP
Overly broad resource ARNs: arn:aws:s3:::bucket/* grants access to everything

Presigned URL Abuse
Presigned URLs are time-limited but can expose more than intended:

Long expiry times (days or weeks) - report as misconfig
Predictable key names - if you can guess the key, you can generate valid paths
Presigned URLs for write (PUT) operations shared with users who shouldn't have write
URL in logs or referrer headers that gets captured by third parties

Bucket Takeover
If a subdomain CNAMEs to an S3 bucket that no longer exists, you can register that bucket name and serve content from their subdomain. Classic subdomain takeover via S3.
# Check if a CNAME points to S3
dig CNAME assets.company.com
# If it resolves to something.s3.amazonaws.com and returns 404/NoSuchBucket, it's takeable
