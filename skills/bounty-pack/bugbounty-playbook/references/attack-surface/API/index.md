API Attack Surface
APIs are where the real money is. Modern apps are mostly thin clients over a backend API, which means the API IS the app for testing purposes. If a program has both a web app and a mobile app, there's a good chance they share the same API, and the mobile client often has looser validation or extra endpoints the web UI doesn't expose.

How API Testing Differs from Web App Testing
Web app testing leans heavily on UI flows and session cookies. API testing is different:

No rendered UI. You're reading raw JSON/protobuf. You have to infer what fields exist and what they mean.
Versioning creates legacy attack surface. /api/v1/ might have auth checks that /api/v2/ forgot to carry forward, or vice versa.
Mass assignment is rampant. ORMs and auto-binding frameworks make it trivial to accidentally accept fields you never intended to expose.
Rate limiting is an afterthought. Most devs add it to login endpoints and forget everything else.
Authorization is per-resolver, not per-route. Especially true in GraphQL. One missing check means you can read or write data you shouldn't.

The methodology shift: stop thinking in "pages" and start thinking in "objects and actions." What objects does this API expose? What actions can I take on them? Which of those actions is my account actually authorized to perform?
Sub-Pages

REST - Endpoint enumeration, auth bypass, mass assignment, rate limiting
GraphQL - Introspection bypass, query DoS, resolver auth gaps, batching attacks
gRPC - Proto reverse engineering, server reflection, grpcurl
API Gateway Bypass - Direct-to-origin, path normalization, header manipulation
WebSocket Security - CSWSH, auth bypass on messages, origin validation, message injection

WebSocket Notes
See the dedicated WebSocket Security page for full testing methodology, CSWSH PoC templates, and Burp setup. The short version: auth happens at the HTTP upgrade request, but subsequent messages often skip authorization checks entirely. Classic pattern: intercept the upgrade in Burp, then replay WS messages from a lower-privileged account to hit actions the server assumes only admins would send.
Quick Wins Checklist

 Enumerate versions: v1, v2, v3, beta, internal, legacy
 Swap HTTP methods (GET vs POST vs PUT vs PATCH vs DELETE)
 Remove or downgrade auth headers entirely
 Add X-Internal: true, X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1, admin-looking headers
 Look for /swagger.json, /openapi.json, /api-docs, /graphql, /graphiql
 Check mobile app traffic against the web app traffic for endpoint delta
