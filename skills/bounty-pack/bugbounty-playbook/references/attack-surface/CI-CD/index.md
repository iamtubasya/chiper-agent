CI/CD Attack Surface
CI/CD pipelines are where secrets live and where they leak. Every build system that has ever touched a production deployment has credentials in it somewhere. The attack surface is broad: the pipeline config files themselves, the runners that execute them, artifact storage, and the trust relationships between the pipeline and the cloud environment it deploys to.
Why CI/CD Matters for Bug Bounty
Most programs consider pipeline compromise high severity. If you can exfiltrate secrets from a CI pipeline, you likely get: cloud provider credentials, code signing keys, deployment tokens, API keys for every third-party service the app uses. That's often a P1.
Supply chain attacks (compromising a dependency or build step to inject malicious code) are explicitly in scope for many programs now, especially after Solar Winds and xz-utils.

Common Entry Points
Pipeline config files in public repos: .github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, .circleci/config.yml, .travis.yml. These reveal the build structure, secret names, and sometimes values.
Workflow injection: Untrusted input (PR titles, commit messages, branch names) flows into shell commands in pipeline steps. Classic in GitHub Actions pull_request_target context.
Self-hosted runner compromise: Runners that execute on company infrastructure with broad network access. Poisoning a build can access internal services.
Artifact exposure: Build artifacts stored publicly or with weak access controls. Container images, binaries, test reports, coverage reports - all can contain secrets.
Dependency confusion / supply chain: Registries that don't pin versions or use internal package names that can be squatted on public registries.
Platforms Covered

GitHub Actions - pull_request_target injection, secret exfil, GITHUB_TOKEN abuse
GitLab CI - Runner exploitation, variable exposure, pipeline manipulation
Jenkins - Script console, credential dumping, Groovy sandbox escape
Secret Leakage - Secrets in build logs, artifact files, env var exposure
Supply Chain - Dependency confusion, typosquatting, package registry attacks

What I Always Check

Public repos with workflow files - look for pull_request_target, secrets passed to untrusted contexts, run: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
Build log artifacts - many programs accidentally expose logs that contain ::add-mask:: failures or unmasked env dumps
OIDC federation - modern pipelines use OIDC to assume cloud roles. Check what roles the pipeline can assume and from which branches/repos
Dependency pinning - uses: some-action@main instead of uses: some-action@SHA is supply chain risk
Self-hosted runner labels - runs-on: self-hosted with broad labels can mean the runner has prod access

General Secret Hunting
# Scan a repo for secrets in history
trufflehog git github.com/target/repo --only-verified
 
# Or locally
gitleaks detect --source /path/to/repo --verbose
 
# Check git history for removed secrets
git log --all --full-history -- "**/*.env" "**/*.pem" "**/credentials*"
git log -p --all | grep -A5 -i "password\|secret\|key\|token"
