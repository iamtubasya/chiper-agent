Secret Leakage in CI/CD
Secrets in CI/CD pipelines leak in predictable ways. Build logs are the most common vector - masking fails silently, debug flags print everything, and error messages helpfully include the value that caused the problem. Artifacts are the second-most-common: test reports, coverage files, and debug dumps end up in artifact storage that's sometimes public.
How Masking Fails
Every CI platform has some form of secret masking ("redact this value from logs"). It's not reliable:

Base64 encoding defeats masking - if your secret is mysecret123 and it's base64-encoded before use, the masked value mysecret123 won't match bXlzZWNyZXQxMjM= in the logs
Multi-line secrets - most platforms mask line-by-line, so a multi-line private key has only the first line masked
Partial exposure - error messages show the first N chars of the value that failed
Command echo before masking - shell set -x or xtrace prints commands before secrets are injected, but sometimes the injection happens after echo
Sub-process handling - secrets passed to Docker --build-arg or subprocess env sometimes don't inherit masking

# GitHub Actions masking bypass via encoding
echo $SECRET | base64    # base64 value won't be masked
echo $SECRET | rev       # reversed value won't be masked
echo ${SECRET:0:10}      # partial value won't be masked (but shorter, might not be useful)
Build Log Enumeration
# GitHub Actions - logs are downloadable via API
curl -H "Authorization: token GH_TOKEN" \
  "api.github.com/repos/ORG/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID/logs" \
  -L -o logs.zip
 
# GitLab CI - job logs accessible via API
curl "gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/PROJECT_ID/jobs/JOB_ID/trace" \
  -H "PRIVATE-TOKEN: TOKEN"
 
# Jenkins - often no auth required
curl "jenkins.target.com/job/JOB_NAME/BUILD_NUMBER/consoleText"
 
# CircleCI - build artifacts and logs
curl "circleci.com/api/v2/project/github/ORG/REPO/pipeline" \
  -H "Circle-Token: TOKEN"
For public repos on GitHub, the Actions logs are publicly readable without auth if the repo is public. I always check recent failed builds - failures are more likely to print debug info.
Artifact Exposure
Build artifacts are the underrated vector. They're stored separately from the code and often have different (weaker) access controls.
What to look for in artifacts:

.env files copied into artifact directory during build
Test configuration files with real credentials used in integration tests
Coverage reports that include source code snippets with secrets
Docker build context archives
Deployment packages with embedded configs
Debug dumps and heap snapshots

# GitHub Actions artifacts via API
curl -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" \
  "api.github.com/repos/ORG/REPO/actions/artifacts"
 
# Download artifact
curl -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" \
  "api.github.com/repos/ORG/REPO/actions/artifacts/ARTIFACT_ID/zip" \
  -L -o artifact.zip
 
# GitLab artifacts
curl "gitlab.com/ORG/REPO/-/jobs/JOB_ID/artifacts/download"
# Or browse artifact files
curl "gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/ID/jobs/JOB_ID/artifacts/path/to/file"
Secret Scanning Bypass
If a program has automated secret scanning (GitHub secret scanning, GitLab secret detection, trufflehog in CI), developers sometimes obfuscate secrets to avoid detection:
# Rotation -- breaking up the string
key = "AKIA" + "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
 
# Environment variable indirection
# REAL_KEY=actual_value stored separately, code does os.environ['REAL_KEY']
 
# Config file split across multiple commits
# First commit: key prefix
# Second commit: key suffix
# History scan needed, not just HEAD
For scanning git history rather than just HEAD:
# trufflehog - scans all commits
trufflehog git github.com/target/repo --only-verified
 
# gitleaks
gitleaks detect --source /path/to/repo --log-opts="--all"
 
# Manual - find commits that touched credential-adjacent files
git log --all --diff-filter=D -- "**/.env" "**/*.pem" "**/credentials*"
git show COMMIT_SHA
Container Image Layers
Docker images are build artifacts and they retain secrets baked into intermediate layers even if a later layer deletes them.
# Pull the image
docker pull target/app:latest
 
# Inspect all layers
docker history target/app:latest --no-trunc
 
# Use dive for interactive layer inspection
dive target/app:latest
 
# Extract and grep all layers
docker save target/app:latest | tar -xO | tar -tz 2>/dev/null | head -50
# Or more thoroughly:
docker create --name temp_container target/app:latest
docker export temp_container | tar -x -C /tmp/image_contents/
grep -r "password\|secret\|key\|token" /tmp/image_contents/ 2>/dev/null
Environment Variable Dumps in Test Suites
Integration tests often dump environment at failure time. If test results are public:
# Check test result artifacts for env dumps
# Common patterns in test output:
# "KeyError: 'DATABASE_URL'" -> reveals the variable name and sometimes context
# pytest --capture=no output
# npm test verbose output with process.env
# Java system property dumps in stack traces
.npmrc, .pypirc, .netrc in Build Contexts
Package manager config files with authentication tokens end up in build contexts and sometimes artifacts:
# Search artifact content for these files
find /extracted_artifact/ -name ".npmrc" -o -name ".pypirc" -o -name ".netrc" \
  -o -name "pip.conf" -o -name "*.npmrc" 2>/dev/null
 
# .npmrc format:
# //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=TOKEN
# //registry.company.com/:_authToken=PRIVATE_TOKEN
 
# .netrc format:
# machine api.example.com login user password SECRETPASSWORD
